            "content_html": "<p>I decided it was time to replace my aging 2015 MacBook Pro. Even though it's still in mint physical condition with a beautiful HiDPI (\"Retina\") display and is generally great to type on, the battery was beginning to show its age and it will become ineligible for OS upgrades in the near future.</p>\n<p>I experimented with a Chromebook for a short while, then found myself <a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/my-new-chromebook-isnt-a-chromebook-at-all/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">running Pop!_OS on a 13\" Dell 2-in-1</a>, which I've enjoyed a lot. Using that machine has generally been a great experience, especially since Ubuntu seems to support all the hardware. My only complaint has been the trackpad - it's just not as precise as I'm used to and can be really frustrating to use. (It's not a Linux problem - it's the same running Windows 10.)</p>\n<p>While immersing myself in some projects at home, I decided that I wanted a more powerful machine with a bigger, matte screen and a passable trackpad. After much deliberation, I bought a <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-inspiron-15-7000-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-7591-laptop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell Inspiron 15 7591\">Dell Inspiron 15 7591</a>. It's an awesome machine that's a joy to type on and, with a 32 GB RAM kit and NVIDIA Graphics, it's screaming fast. The trackpad is pretty damn good, too, and the aluminium shell feels and looks great. It supports two NVMe drives and yet another 2.5\" mass storage drive (SSD, Hybrid or Hard Drive). It's a beautiful beast that won't break the bank.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/inspiron_7591.png\" alt=\"Dell Inspiron 15 7591\" width=\"1140\" height=\"473\">\n<figcaption >Image Credit: Dell</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Full Disclosure: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfederico/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"John Federico on LinkedIn.com\">I work for Dell</a> running software partnerships, making this post a little...uncomfortable to write. I'm not involved in the hardware side of the business in any way other than I can sometimes get my hands on some machines before they're released to the <a href=\"#mcetoc_1e5km0bsc0\" title=\"Footnotes\">public*</a>.) <span >😉</span></p>\n<p>I was generally in love with the 7591, but there was just one problem with it: I couldn't get it to properly run any flavor of Linux. Even though the machine is <a href=\"https://certification.ubuntu.com/hardware/201903-26880\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell Inspiron 15 7591 Ubuntu Certification\">Ubuntu Certified</a> (which is a key reason I chose it), I couldn't get the PCI sound card to work. USB audio input and output both worked fine, but troubleshooting the built-in sound card was an exercise in frustration.</p>\n<p>I think we all take for granted that our laptops can play sound until you find yourself trying to learn something from a YouTube video and have to switch to a different PC or your smartphone.</p>\n<p>Since the machine didn't ship with Ubuntu pre-installed, I was unable to get support from Dell. Look, I get it: successfully supporting millions of consumers (many of them not very tech savvy) is no small feat. If you buy a new car, then completely replace the engine with something else, you can't expect the manufacturer to support it. This appears to be industry wide, not just at Dell. (Though, I will ask, why bother certifying a PC for Ubuntu if you're not going to support it with that OS? But, I digress...)</p>\n<p>The Pop!_OS and Ubuntu communities are great resources, but I finally gave up after three weeks and sold it on eBay. The shop where I bought the 32 GB RAM kit won't accept returns unless the memory is DOA and I didn't feel like negotiating the restocking fee on the PC, nor create a support incident for the Dell support team to deal with - with so many people working from home now, they are likely overwhelmed. It was easier to just restore the Windows 10 OS factory image and sell it as \"New, Open Box.\"</p>\n<p>So, even as I returned to my 13\" machine, I was trying to figure out my options. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a PC that wasn't my daily driver, I wasn't willing to buy a similar machine and hope for a better trackpad and, most importantly, I didn't want to have to wrestle with a PC from any major OEM to get Linux running on it. Even users of Thinkpads, which are famously great for supporting Linux across the product line, were having issues getting Ubuntu to run properly on models that I would have considered.</p>\n<p>I wanted a Linux machine with hardware support out of the box, but any device with Linux pre-installed from a major PC OEM is typically sold as a \"<a href=\"#mcetoc_1e5km0bsc0\" title=\"Footnote\">Developer Edition*</a>,\" which means it's <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/overview/cp/linuxsystems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell Project Sputnik\">built - and priced - for business use</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image post__image--center\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/System76-System76_Logo_Blue-by_Kate_Hazen_of_System76.jpg\" alt=\"System76 Branded Desktop Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></p>\n<p>So, I started searching for other PC's with Linux pre-installed and, not surprisngly, System76 kept popping up with great reviews and a huge community of super fans. Of course, I knew of System76 as they're the creator and maintainer of Pop!_OS, but I was still thinking (hoping?) that I could get a better spec'd and more economical machine from Dell that would run Linux.</p>\n<p>As I was overthinking the whole decision, I made my 3,000th visit to the Sytem76 web site so I could (again) configure a 15\" <a href=\"https://system76.com/laptops/darter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Darter Pro on System76.com\">Darter Pro</a> machine and noticed that System76 was about to release a new PC - the 2020 14\" <a href=\"https://system76.com/laptops/lemur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Lemur Pro on System76.com\">Lemur Pro</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/lemur_pro.png\" alt=\"Lemur Pro\" width=\"952\" height=\"582\">\n<figcaption >Image Credit: System76</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/lemur_pro_angles.png\" alt=\"Lemur Pro from different angles\" width=\"1327\" height=\"769\">\n<figcaption >Image Credit: System76</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In addition to all of the other benefits of a System76 machine (Disabled Intel ME, CoreBoot open source firmware, full Pop!_Os support, etc.) they were touting 14 hours of battery life, a 10th Gen Intel Core processor, a matte 1080p display and up to 40 GB of RAM in a slim, attractive PC with a modern, no-button trackpad.</p>\n<p>I subscribed to the Early Access mailing list and put it out of my mind for awhile. (Probably only a day or so, if I'm being honest with myself.) About a week later, while I was literally dealing with the frustration of using the trackpad on my current machine, I received an email from System76 informing me that I could place one of the first orders for a Lemur Pro. (True to their word, only customers who showed early interest could configure and order one. Random web site visitors had to wait another day or so. That impressed me.)</p>\n<p>I configured and ordered a Lemur Pro with 40 GB RAM and a 512 GB NVMe drive. (I can still add another NVMe drive, if I have a need for it.)</p>\n<p>The next morning, I received both a friendly email and a phone call from System76, letting me know that my order was processed and that it was in the production queue. (Each System76 machine is built-to-order.) 24 hours later, I received another email message telling me that my machine was built and on its way to me via UPS.</p>\n<p>My Lemur Pro arrived four days later. UPS required a signature for delivery but I was able to just flash my ID through the glass on our front door and the driver left it on the porch - a perfect COVID-19, no-contact delivery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e5ko9see1\">Unboxing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e62ogl9jg\">First Impressions</h3>\n<p>I'm not going to lie: when I was exploring Linux distros, one of the reasons I was attracted to Pop!_OS was the brand messaging, desktop graphics and overall user experience of the OS. I found their packaging to be consistent with that and right on-brand. </p>\n<p>In what appears to be taking a queue from Apple, System76 ships the device secured in a reusable plastic-and-cardboard mechanism. It's worth keeping around in case you need to ship your machine for service or maybe want to sell it in the future.</p>\n<p>The envelope containing System76 and Pop!_OS stickers was a nice touch.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/system76_closed_box.jpg\" ><img

id=\"mcetoc_1e61vbefv0\">Weight &amp; Design</h3>\n<p>The Lemur Pro is as powerful as the current MacBook Pro but weighs <em>less.</em> <strong>I</strong>t's also ligher than the current MacBook Air and even ligher than the amazing <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-7390-2-in-1-laptop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"XPS 7391 on Dell.com\">XPS 13\" 7391</a> that I use every day at work. (Though, to be fair, the 7391 is a 2-in-1 and has some added weight due to the touchscreen and sophisticated hinge mechanism.)</p>\n<p>The Lemur Pro is so light that I can load both my work machine <em>and</em> my personal machine into my backpack and not even realize that I'm carrying two PC's. Even better, both machines can be powered by USC Type-C Power Delivery, so I only have to carry one charger. This will be great for business trips, when I want to work on personal projects after hours or watch movies on the plane.</p>\n<p>The design is the same as what you would expect from any top-tier PC OEM. It has clean lines and relatively modern design touches. The System76 logo on the lid appears to be laser etched.</p>\n<p>The biggest and most obvious design decision was the webcam. Rather than increase the size of the bezel, System76 decided to add a small bump above the screen to house the camera and built-in microphone. It's not distracting at all when using the machine, but obviously protrudes by a few millimeters when the lid is closed. I'm hoping that the chassis will adequately protect it during transit.</p>\n<p>For some unknown reason, System76 made the decision to place the power button on the right<strong> side</strong> of the machine, not on the keyboard deck. Depending on your perspective, this could be a poor design choice, something to just get used to, or both.</p>\n<p>During my first full day of using the Lemur Pro, I plugged-in a USB Type-C cable with Power Delivery and DisplayPort (which is on the left side) so that I could use it with my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2K9NA6f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell U3818DW\">38\" Dell display</a> to get some work done. Naturally, since the machine is so light, I braced it with my right hand and accidentally pushed the power button, putting it into Suspend mode. I definitely need to remember that in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e61vbms51\">Materials &amp; Build Quality</h3>\n<p>At the time this post is written, System76 doesn't indicate what materials are used to build the Lemur Pro chassis on its web site. While looking at the photos during the buying process, I guessed that it was a nice, Thinkpad-like plastic or some kind of aluminum or magnesium alloy.</p>\n<p>After it arrived, I realized it was metal but didn't know what kind, so I asked the System76 support team and they responded almost immediately:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Hello John,<br><br>Glad you're enjoying the Lemur Pro! The chassis is made out of Magnesium-Aluminum alloy: 9% Aluminum, 90% Magnesium, 1% other material. (Before you ask, I do not know what the \"other material\" is; I assume our supplier simply includes that as a tolerance.) Please let us know if you have any other questions! --Jacob</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Thanks, Jacob.</em></p>\n<p>The Magnesium-Aluminum alloy is smooth to the touch and in my short time using it, appears to reject fingerprints. (Though, System76 includes a microfiber cloth with the system, so perhaps this is a premature observation.) It has tiny reflective flecks of material that only appear in the right light and from the right perspective. This may be a conscious design choice or just a natural charateristic of the alloy. Those flecks might also be the \"1% other material\" but I'm just guessing.</p>\n<p>Fit and finish are excellent with no visible gaps or imperfections. There is no flexing of the chassis or the keyboard deck - it's a solid typing experience. In fact, it's one of the best keyboards I've used in a long time, almost on par with my 2015 MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>The bottom panel flexes a wee bit but it doesn't detract from the overall build quality of the machine. I've only noticed it when I close the lid and grip the PC with one hand.</p>\n<p>The 14.1\" 1080p screen has a matte finish and is bright, crisp and seemingly color accurate. The Lemur Pro's screen is pleasingly larger than my 13\" devices and the form factor is just about perfect.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Even though it would be nice to have a larger screen on-the-go, I recently discovered that the tradeoffs of a 15.6\" machine just aren't worth it - especially the keyboard layout.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">I don't understand why just about every PC OEM feels the need to fill the keyboard deck of larger devices with a number pad, shifting the trackpad and keyboard to the left. It's an awkward experience. Instead of the number pad, why not center the keyboard and add front-firing speakers on each side or a maybe just a fingerprint reader that actually works more than 20% of the time? Anyone who really needs a number pad can get one from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XENFXu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"USB Numbers Pads on Amazon.com\">Amazon for less than $20</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e62rs7enh\">Trackpad</h4>\n<p>The trackpad on this machine is excellent. Is it as good as a MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS? Not quite, but it's pretty damn close. The fact that it doesn't have buttons is a real plus.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e62nfi3mf\">Power Supply</h4>\n<p>From the perspective of portability, the power supply is great. It's relatively small and lightweight and gets the job done.

In seconds, the machine booted into system setup.</p>\n<p>If you've ever installed Pop!_OS on your machine, the experience of having it installed on a new PC is exactly the same as booting from a live session: select your country, keyboard layout, disk encryption preference, etc. When it's done, it will ask you to create a user, after a restart.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/neofetch.png\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/neofetch-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"neofetch on my System76 Lemur Pro\" width=\"768\" height=\"435\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">neofetch on my System76 Lemur Pro</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e62eso1da\">Processor &amp; GPU</h4>\n<p>The CPU is a 10th Generation Intel i7 processor (an upgrade from the 10th Gen i5 in the base model Lemur Pro) in the \"U\" spec, which indicates that it's designed for Ultrabooks that require longer battery life. Spec-for-spec, it certainly doesn't pack the horespower of the Dell Inspiron 7591 I gave up.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">The Dell Inspiron 7591 has a 9th Gen Intel i7 in the \"H\" spec (high performance) with 6 cores - 12 threads, 12 MB cache and burst mode up to 4.5 GHz. More importantly, it has a dedicated NVIDIA GPU which helps render video faster. (And improves gaming performance, but I'm not much of a gamer.)</p>\n<p>With that said, the Lemur Pro defintely punches above its weight. It's surprisingly fast for its specs and the onboard Intel GPU works well, powering both the built-in display and my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cwwFXN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell U3818DW Curved Display\">large (3840 x 1600) external display</a> simultaneously. Video playback and video conferences are smooth and consistent.</p>\n<p>It quickly renders web pages in Firefox, which is typically a small step behind the speed of the Chromium and WebKit rendering engines.</p>\n<p><strong>GeekBench</strong></p>\n<p>Running Geekbench5, the Lemur Pro scored better in Multi-core tests than the Intel 8th Gen U series processor in a Dell Inspiron 7386, but lower in Single-core tests. You can see the full results of the Lemur Pro test <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/1817319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"GeekBench Scores for the System76 Lemur Pro\">here</a> and the Dell test <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/1717304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"GeekBench 5 test results for the Dell Inspiron 7386\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/geekbench.png\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/geekbench-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"GeekBench5 results on my System76 Lemur Pro\" width=\"768\" height=\"124\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">GeekBench5 results on my System76 Lemur Pro</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Here's the obiligatory screenshot of HTOP running in a terminal window.

During those instances, I was installing multiple package updates from Pop!_Shop or running a video conference in Zoom.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the machine runs quite cool. I can barely feel any excess heat when it's on my lap during general use. (I'm sure I might have a different experience if I was rendering a 4K video with compositing while sitting on the couch.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e61vcb4s4\">RAM</h4>\n<p>Do I really need 40 GB of RAM for a machine that I'm using for hobby projects?</p>\n<p>Generally, no.</p>\n<p>While I do some light video production, photo editing and vector art production, I use my machine mostly for office work, Raspberry Pi and other SBC projects, managing my home lab and testing home automation scripts. </p>\n<p>But I want to <strong>fly</strong> through my workflows. When I'm in The Zone, I don't want to deal with a lagging OS. Having excess memory ensures that the OS almost never has to write anything to the swap partition on the disk. (Also referred to as \"Virtual RAM.\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Virtual RAM on Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n<p>Plus, maxing out the RAM ensures that the machine will have a long service life without much effort, and the additional memory improves its resale value should I decide to upgrade to a new machine in the future.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e61vcfpk5\">Storage</h4>\n<p>My preferred configuration is to have a small (&lt;250 GB) NVMe drive for the OS and a second, larger NVMe drive for my /home directory and files. However, after lots of shopping around, it doesn't appear that the smaller NVMe drives even come close to the performance of those that are 500 GB or larger, which is an important consideration for the OS drive.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I selected the smallest, fastest NVMe drive available during system configuration for both the OS and my files - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VchDk4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Samsung EVO Pro\">a 512 GB Samsung EVO Pro</a>. I could have gotten a 1 TB drive with the same read/write specs, but most of my larger media files are stored on NAS on my LAN, and in the cloud. I can upgrade to a larger drive or add a second drive at a later time, if I need it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e61vcm076\">Networking</h4>\n<p>The Lemur Pro uses the onboard Intel networking controller with the 802.11ac spec and speeds up to 867 Mbps. I have other machines with 802.11ac but this feels much snappier, perhaps because web pages render so quickly. File transfers over SAMBA, SFTP, NFS and HTTPS also seemed very fast.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e61vlsac9\">Battery Life</h4>\n<p>If you've read this far, you know that I am not a professional PC reviewer so I had to improvise the battery life evaluation.</p>\n<p>Here's what I did:</p>\n<p>I unplugged the machine from the power supply and spent 4 hours writing this post, responding to email, watching YouTube tutorials on how to optimize OpenMediaVault and NextCloud, downloading software, and connecting with friends and family on social media.</p>\n<p>I didn't do any video rendering or stream a ton of HD video, and I didn't compile any code. Basically, I just used it like an average consumer.</p>\n<p>At the end of the 4 hours, my battery was at 91%. Pop!_OS indicated that I still had over 20 hours of use. The Pop!_OS power management profile was set to \"Balanced.\"</p>\n<p>It's not a scientific benchmark, but it should give you some idea about the battery life of the Lemur Pro: it's remarkable.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/power_after_4_hours.png\" alt=\"Power Indicator after 4 hours\" width=\"327\" height=\"445\">\n<figcaption >Power indicator after 4 hours of use.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Eventually, I'll get a feel for how the battery life holds up under heavier loads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e62ini9lc\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I provided my opinion of this laptop based on my specific needs using my own decision making criteria. However, I'm hoping that based on my experience, you can get a sense of how well it might work for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e62iung6e\">Positives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Premium specs, look and feel</li>\n<li>Light, Magnesium-Alloy chassis</li>\n<li>Bright, color-accurate, matte-finish 1080p screen </li>\n<li>Solid keyboard with good key travel</li>\n<li>Ample ports</li>\n<li>USB Type-C Power Delivery with Display Port</li>\n<li>Powerful CPU that runs cool during general use</li>\n<li>Quiet fans</li>\n<li>Excellent trackpad performance</li>\n<li>Pop!_OS (of course)</li>\n<li><em>Complete hardware support</em> for Pop!_OS</li>\n<li>An envelope full of cool stickers <span >😉</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e62uo586i\">Neutrals:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Slight chassis flex in certain use cases</li>\n<li>Camera bump on the top screen bezel</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e62iud50d\">Negatives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Poorly placed power button</li>\n<li>The power supply cables are waaayyy too short</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Lemur Pro and am now wondering why I didn't buy a System76 machine sooner.</p>\n<p>Do you have a Lemur Pro? Do you want one? Do you have specific questions about things I didn't cover?</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments or on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gadgetboy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"@gadgetboy on twitter\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h6 id=\"mcetoc_1e5km0bsc0\">Footnotes</h6>\n<p>* If you have the budget and you're looking for a machine pre-installed with Ubuntu, you owe it to yourself to explore a <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/overview/cp/linuxsystems#tab-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition\">Dell XPS 13 or 15 Developer Edition</a>.

He’d never installed one of these before and had <strong>only watched a YouTube video</strong>. I immediately lost confidence.</p>\n<p>And, boy, was I right.</p>\n<p>Step number one in any job like this: label all your wires before you pull everything apart. Even though there were supposed to be six zones, he labelled only three wires – and they were all labelled incorrectly. In fact, he installed the <strong>AC power</strong> and <strong>siren</strong> connections as zones. (Thankfully, I had already disconnected the power or he would have fried the unit.)</p>\n<p>I had to remove the old alarm system while he was <strong>reading the documentation on his phone</strong> and talking to his manager because he thought he was going to install a <strong>wireless</strong> system in the existing steel box. <strong>Nothing</strong> about the Retrofit Kit worked when he left. His “manager was going to call me to reschedule” but that never happened.</p>\n<p>I contacted them for a refund and they were supposed to get back to me “in the morning.” That also never happened. I finally disputed the charge with my credit card issuer.</p>\n<p>The next day, I ended up pulling apart his mess and installing the system myself. It took me about an hour. But what I discovered during the installation process <strong>really</strong> pissed me off.</p>\n<p>When we bought the house, the alarm was pre-installed during construction. (The best time to do it, natch.) The installers wired everything to a <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"DSC PC1616 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.dsc.com/index.php?n=products&amp;o=view&amp;id=1\" target=\"_blank\">DSC PC1616</a> – a six zone alarm system. However, there are <strong>20</strong> wired zones. They spliced numerous zones into single zone ports on the alarm system and just labelled them “Garage-Office-Dining Room-Back Door.”</p>\n<p>It was a total clusterf*ck.</p>\n<p>First, because it was a <strong>hack</strong> and second, because the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit runs on Lithium batteries – and there isn’t nearly enough power to activate and monitor multiple zones on a single circuit.</p>\n<p>Since each Retrofit Alarm Kit only has eight zones, I ended up having to buy a second unit so that I could properly wire each zone. For those of you doing the math at home, yes, there will be a few zones that aren’t wired, but all of them require a thirty-foot ladder to get near them, so I feel comfortable leaving them that way, for now. I may grab a third unit when they go on sale in the future, just to make sure all zones are wired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e34v4h1n1\">Finishing Touches</h2>\n<p>My final configuration will be to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028205592-Using-Alexa-Guard-with-Alarm-to-Detect-Broken-Glass-Smoke-and-Carbon-Monoxide\" target=\"_blank\">set up our Echo devices with Alexa Guard to act as glass break, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors</a>.

This is a huge bonus – I don’t have to buy any additional hardware** to let the monitoring station know which sensor is triggered. If no one responds to the safety check, they’ll simply send the appropriate emergency service to the house.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of the whole set up is the remote access. We can now arm and disarm every sensor in the system from our smartphones wherever we are and also grant access to friends and family by giving them a temporary passcode. The convenience is great.</p>\n<p>The icing on the proverbial cake?</p>\n<p>The professional monitoring from Ring is half the cost of monitoring from my existing service provider – and I didn’t have to pay extra for the cellular hardware. The purchase of the Ring products will almost pay for themselves in the <s>first</s> second year and the system includes all the convenience we’ve been waiting for.</p>\n<p>I’ll unload the old system on eBay or Facebook Marketplace.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e66m4aml0\">Footnotes</h4>\n<p>*Only 8 zones are supported.</p>\n<p>**If you don’t have an Echo device, you can purchase <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/35l5LyL\" target=\"_blank\">a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms</a> and send the appropriate trigger to the monitoring station.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When my son started at his new school, he needed a conventional PC. After finding him a 2015 MacBook Air in perfect condition for a veritable steal on eBay, I adopted his Chromebook – a Dell Inspiron 3180 with an 11.6 inch screen, Intel Celeron processor, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of eMMC storage.</p>\n<p>I enjoy using it. It runs for 8 or 9 hours on a charge, it has a beautiful HD-ish touch screen and it allows me to install Android apps. These Android apps are treated just like apps on a smartphone, allowing me to access my corporate email and connect to Skype for Business.</p>\n<p>I recently used it on a trip to New York City and it fit well on the tray table in United Economy class and was speedy on the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>For context, I’ve been using Mac OS X exclusively since OS X Jaguar was released in 2002. I had the privilege of either working for myself or bringing my own device to work, so Mac OS was my daily driver and I became proficient in using it and the software designed for it. That changed in January 2018 when I began working for a large company that standardized on Windows 10 PC’s.</p>\n<p>While I still have my 2015 MacBook Pro, my interest in the Chromebook was more about daily, personal use – email, social media, writing, watching videos, doing research – and less about the things I used to do on my Mac which included more advanced workflows like image editing and audio and video production.</p>\n<p>After a couple of months, I found the screen on the Chromebook just a wee bit too small and the processor just a wee bit too slow to render web pages and web apps like Office 365 Online (needed for my work), so I started exploring modern Linux distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e366h7nm0\">Like coming home – only more modern</h2>\n<p>Linux is not new to me. I started running Linux under <a href=\"http://www.slackware.com/announce/1.0.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Slackware 1.0</a> and had to build a custom PC just to use it, since so few components were supported in the early 90’s. A lot has changed since then.</p>\n<p>I decided to experiment with Linux on a more powerful <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LvmZ4y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">2-in-1 Dell Inspiron 7000</a> device. It’s a great design with a beautiful high resolution Gorilla Glass screen, aluminium body, i7 processor, 16 GB RAM and a lot more storage.</p>\n<p>My first few attempts at installation (<a href=\"https://www.linuxmint.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Linux Mint</a>) were challenging. This PC is designed to run Windows 10 and there were some BIOS configuration changes I had to figure out in order to convince the machine that it could install Linux instead of Windows.</p>\n<p>After a lot of Googling and even more trial and error, I finally got Linux Mint installed. It’s a vastly better experience than Windows and much more powerful than an off-the-shelf Chromebook. When it comes down to it, I use it for the same tasks as the Chromebook, except I’m not limited to Chrome OS and browser apps – I can run software applications natively in the OS.</p>\n<p>I don’t see myself giving up my Mac for a Linux machine for tasks like video editing, podcasting or image editing, but I don’t do those things very often any more. But, with a Linux installation, I have the option to occasionally perform those tasks whereas those options were limited in Chrome OS.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, I felt that Linux Mint was <em>too much</em> like Windows and just didn’t feel like the Chromebook or Mac OS experiences I prefer, so I started looking at other desktop environments.</p>\n<p>After exploring vanilla Ubuntu, Elementary OS and Plasma 5, I finally settled on <a href=\"https://pop.system76.com/docs/difference-between-pop-ubuntu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Pop!_OS from System76</a>.</p>\n<p>The experience is wonderful – it’s well designed, roomy and feels much more like the elegant experience I’m used to on the Mac. The GNOME-based desktop environment is simple and uncluttered and the speed at which apps perform and web pages load is even faster than my MacBook Pro. (I guess that’s obvious given that the Mac has specs from 2015, but still.)</p>\n<p>System maintenance is even more like a Mac. For instance, like Mac OS and Windows 10, the OS lets me know when there are software updates available and prompts me to upgrade. All I have to do is enter my credentials and the OS takes care of everything for me. In the “good old days,” of using Linux, I had to monitor the web and Usenet for software updates, then download and compile them from source code.</p>\n<p>Those days are gone.</p>\n<p>There’s also an “app store” called Pop!_Shop where you can find a curated catalog of commonly used Linux software. Again, all updates are managed by the OS, just like Mac OS or Windows 10.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\">\n<figcaption >Pop! Shop</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e366h7nm1\">Why not just get a new Mac or a faster Chromebook?</h2>\n<p>A new Mac is overkill for my personal computing needs. I love my MacBook Pro and would be happy to be able to use it as my daily driver again, but I don’t see that happening any time soon.</p>\n<p>A faster Chromebook would serve my usual needs, but why spend just about as much on a high-performance Chromebook to only have the limited functionality of Chrome OS? (Comparison: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38dSQR2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Google Pixel</a> vs. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2s3JTJt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Dell Inspiron 7000</a>)</p>\n<p>A Linux laptop running Pop!_OS fits squarely in between an under-powered, education-oriented Chromebook and a new MacBook at a much more competitive price. I get high-performance access to my cloud services but can also occasionally run <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Gimp</a> for image editing or <a href=\"https://www.openshot.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">OpenShot</a> for a quick video edit.</p>\n<p>My biggest complaint has been battery life. Again, the battery performance claims for this machine are based on Windows 10 with drivers designed specifically for this hardware. It took me a bit of Googling to learn about modern Linux battery management before I could get the machine to run longer than a couple of hours on a charge. In addition to the Pop!_OS battery management tools (which are pretty good), I eventually installed <a href=\"https://www.tecmint.com/tlp-increase-and-optimize-linux-battery-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">TLP</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/09/tlpui-is-graphical-user-interface-for.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">TLPGUI</a> for more advanced battery management. After a few weeks of use with this setup, I’ve found battery life to be more than acceptable.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/tlpgui.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"772\">\n<figcaption >TLP GUI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e366h7nm2\">Is this setup right for you?</h2>\n<p>If you’re like me and most of your personal computing is cloud-based (or could be), I think you’d be surprised how much of your needs can be met by a set up like this.</p>\n<p>Sure, you might not want to go through the hassle of tweaking the BIOS settings to get Linux to install, but really, once that’s done, installation is just like Mac OS or Windows 10. (<a href=\"https://system76.com/laptops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">You could also buy a machine preloaded with Pop!_OS from System76</a> but that option is not as attractive – both in cost and design – as a PC from a major OEM.)</p>\n<p>If you prefer Mac OS-style computing, you can install a desktop environment that looks and behaves almost exactly like the Mac. Ditto for Windows. You can run your favorite browser (<a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/microsoft-edge-linux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">even if your favorite browser is Microsoft Edge</a>) to work with G Suite, Office 365 Online – even Apple iCloud.</p>\n<p>That’s because <strong>using</strong> Pop!_OS is easy. If I set up a PC for my wife running Pop!_OS, she could complete her usual tasks with almost no learning curve. But she’s definitely not the sort of person to figure out how to get the PC to accept the installation. It’s not her thing.</p>\n<p>Maybe there’s a cottage industry in setting up user-friendly Linux installations on a device that a customer already owns? Probably not enough mass appeal there, but it’s an interesting idea.</p>\n<p>If you want a quick run through of Pop!_OS you can watch the short video below. There are plenty of others on YouTube but they’re mostly reviews by Linux geeks, for Linux geeks.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4TAm9PGvbw\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ></iframe></figure>",

            "content_html": "<p>I have a history with vacuums.</p>\n<p>When I was 11 years old, I disassembled the vacuum to see how the parts worked, then rushed to put it back together before my Mom got home. (It still worked.) From that experience, my brother nicknamed me Gadgetboy, so this post is quite fitting.</p>\n<p>When my wife and I moved our family to Austin, we ended up buying a ginormous house, partly because my wife and I both needed home offices, partly because we like this community and couldn’t wait for a more suitably sized house to be built, since we had to enroll our son for the new school year.</p>\n<p>We haven’t regretted our purchase, except for the one thing we didn’t consider: cleaning it.</p>\n<p>Cleaning a house of this size is an all-day affair for two adults. We finally admitted defeat and hired someone to do it a couple of times a month, but that’s still not enough – especially when there are two teenagers, two adults and two dogs living here. The dark wood floors ultimately get covered in tumble weeds of dog hair mixed with crumbs from dog treats.</p>\n<p>My wife and I both work crazy hours and the last thing we want to do is have to clean again in between cleaning service, so I began exploring robot vacuums.</p>\n<p>For years, the only good robot vacuum was a Roomba. It was crazy expensive and never quite as good as a traditional vacuum, but a lot has changed in the past few years. You can find a decent robot vacuum for around $200 these days which will work fine for a small house or apartment.</p>\n<p>But our needs are a little different. We needed something that could clean our ground floor relatively quickly and consistently. But before I share my experience, let me give you a quick rundown of considerations when buying one of these suckers.</p>\n<p>What’s important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suction power</li>\n<li>Battery life</li>\n<li>Bin size</li>\n<li>Ability to work on hard floors and carpet</li>\n<li>Warranty</li>\n<li>Repairability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s about it.</p>\n<p>(If you really want to geek out when shopping for a robot vacuum, visit the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvavJlMjlTd4wLwi9yKCtew\">Vacuum Wars YouTube channel</a>. Yes, that’s a thing.)</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, there is one critical and sometimes overlooked feature of a robot vacuum, especially for larger homes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e368b3950\">Navigation</h2>\n<p>There are basically two types of navigation: the random, bumping-around-the-house-until-it’s-clean type, and the more intelligent, S-patterned type.</p>\n<p>Inexpensive robot vacuums will basically just bounce off of objects around your home until its onboard software determines that it has covered the area it’s supposed to clean. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but in larger homes, it can take a long time, especially since it will vacuum over spots it has already cleaned until it has completely covered the floor. This approach also makes it more likely that the robot needs to return to the dock to recharge during a session, extending the completion time even further.</p>\n<p>Also, as part of any navigation system, you’ll want to be able to block the vacuum from going to certain places like, say, your kids playroom or keeping the vacuum from falling down stairs. Inexpensive vacuums can do this but they usually require the placement of some sort of signalling tape that you place around your home. It’s not the most attractive option.</p>\n<p>If you want to clean larger spaces more quickly, you need more advanced navigation. That’s where the S-patterned approach comes in.</p>\n<p>The first time this type of vacuum goes about its business, it will behave more-or-less like the navigation described above. After that, it has captured a map of your home in its onboard software and that’s where things get interesting – and faster.</p>\n<p>Once the robot knows the basic layout of your home, it will begin to vacuum floors in a regular back-and-forth motion until it has reached the end of the room, then it will switch to another room and repeat the process until all of your designated floors are clean.</p>\n<p>After researching robot vacuums (and watching <em>way</em> too many Vacuum Wars videos) I decided that this type of navigation was the best option for us.</p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI\">Roborock S5 </a>went on sale (and I had a bunch of Amazon affiliate earnings banked) I made the purchase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e368b3951\">Meet Rosie</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//roborock_s5.jpg\" alt=\"RoboRock S5\" width=\"930\" height=\"1024\">\n<figcaption >RoboRock S5</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Setting up the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI\">Roborock S5</a> was easy as pie. I unboxed it, plugged in the charger and placed it in its new home. While it was charging, I set up the mobile app (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mi-home-xiaomi-smarthome/id957323480\">Mi Home</a>) on my iPhone and connected the robot to my Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>As part of the process, I had the option to name it.</p>\n<p>I named it Rosie.</p>\n<p>For those of my generation, you’ll remember Rosie, the robot house keeper from The Jetsons. It’s a perfect, geeky, nostalgic name choice.</p>\n<p>When it was fully charged, I gave it a go.</p>\n<p>During its first run, it had a difficult time getting itself up onto the high-pile area rug in the living room and a few times, I realized that I forgot to put away the dog toys or slippers, so I had to run around the house to pick those up. Other than that, it did a nice job of cleaning the floors.</p>\n<p>The second time I ran it, I got the following results.<img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/img-2004.jpg\" alt=\"Floor Map\" width=\"650\" height=\"1023\"></p>\n<p>The yellow dot is Rosie’s home, in the dining room, next to the sideboard.</p>\n<p>Notice the S-pattern throughout the house in almost every room.

            "content_html": "<p>What do you do when you’re “Directionally Challenged” and need GPS to get around on your motorcycle?</p>\n<p>This is something I’ve been wrestling with for 5+ years.</p>\n<p>It’s not that difficult, really. Moto GPS units have been around for decades and there are plenty of smartphone mounts to choose from if you prefer to use Google Maps or one of its ilk.</p>\n<p>I’m very particular about my bike and what sort of bits and bobs I put on it. But it’s a lot more than that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm40\">Things to consider</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm41\">Smartphone or dedicated GPS unit?</h3>\n<p>This is an easy decision. The smartphone in your pocket is better than just about any moto GPS unit you can buy today and it’s always up-to-date. Moto GPS units from companies like Garmin sometimes require that you hook it up to a computer to upgrade the maps and sometimes for a fee.</p>\n<p>If you’re just riding around town or on a day trip with your friends, why bother with that? I use my iPhone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm42\">Style</h3>\n<p>I love my bike and don’t want anything to interfere with its aesthetics. I ride what is referred to as a Modern Classic – a bike that resembles (or sometimes looks exactly like) its original versions from the early 20th century – but with modern upgrades to fuel intake, brakes, catalytic converters, etc.</p>\n<p>I tend to like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_racer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Café Racer (opens in a new tab)\">Café Racer</a> styling, made popular in 1960’s England, which is simple, clean and reduced to its barest necessities. With that in mind, hanging stuff on the bike is anathema to that. Trust me – <a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/2017/02/01/2017-1-29-heritage-motorcycle-luggage-project/\">choosing luggage for my previous bike was an agonizing process</a>, especially since I refused to spend what is typically hundreds of dollars for a moto side bag.</p>\n<p>Style has been a huge factor in my decision making process, especially when I’ve seen riders attach <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"these monstrosities (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2PRl9jl\" target=\"_blank\">these monstrosities</a> to their bikes. When deciding on a mount, I want something small and unobtrusive that blends with the style and color of the bike, not something that looks like an odd appendage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm43\">Security</h3>\n<p>Even though style is important to me, this is really <strong>the</strong> most important thing to consider. You don’t want a $1,000 smartphone flying off your bike at 75 mph. There are <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"countless mounts available (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2UrGtu7\" target=\"_blank\">countless mounts available</a> and just as many horror stories (and videos!) of riders losing their smartphones because of them.</p>\n<p>Sure, my iPhone is insured, (you were expecting otherwise? 😉 ) but I just don’t need the complication of replacing a phone. I want something that’s going to work reliably.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm44\">Voice Navigation</h3>\n<p>I need turn-by-turn voice navigation. Getting around any city, especially Austin, Texas, can be a dangerous proposition and you don’t want to take your eyes off the road to look for your next turn. For longer <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Hill Country (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Hill_Country\" target=\"_blank\">Hill Country</a> rides, it’s fine to quickly look at a screen to see how far you are from your next turn, but not in the city.</p>\n<p>For years, I’ve been wearing <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Ultimate Ears barrel-style (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2NIuAi2\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Ears barrel-style</a> headphones under my helmet connected to my iPhone in my jacket pocket for voice navigation. These type of headphones perform double duty as they also protect your hearing from wind and engine noise. Also important: the headphone wires are directed downward at all times – you don’t have to worry about wrapping anything around your ears and having the wires or headphones shift around under your helmet.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\" >\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"post__image align-center\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/71yvit0zus._sl1500_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"354\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>There a couple of downsides to this method. The biggest is that some mapping apps (Waze, for instance) don’t really behave well when operating with the screen turned off which, of course, you have to do since it’s in your pocket and leaving the screen on would trigger all sorts of unwanted commands. I’ve also found that the device will sometimes lose its GPS signal or simply think that I’ve paused my route, requiring that I pull over, take off my gloves, dig the phone out of the inside pocket and restart the route. Having a mount would reduce some of this inconvenience, especially if I bought a pair of touchscreen-friendly moto gloves.</p>\n<p>If voice navigation is important, then the downside to using a mount is that you now need to consider how you get the sound from the phone on the handlebars to your ears. Dangling wires are a safety hazard and probably wouldn’t survive for long at high speeds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm45\">Bluetooth</h3>\n<p>Bluetooth is, of course, the answer to the above problem but typical bluetooth headphones just don’t work. The best I found were the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"torc-style headphones from LG (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2NItmU9\" target=\"_blank\">torc-style headphones from LG</a> but the device controls (play/pause, skip, volume, etc.) would constantly get triggered under the collar of my jacket. Wearing them outside the jacket collar wasn’t an option as the torc would fly off.</p>\n<p>After some searching, I found <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2LiGRZc\" target=\"_blank\">this adapter that adds bluetooth capabilities to wired headphones</a>. I’ve taken it for a few test rides and it works as advertised. Music doesn’t sound great but that’s not as big of a concern for me.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\" >\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/61hu3f0cxl._sl1317_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>(TIP: If I didn’t already own the one mentioned above, I’d would get <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"this new one (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2MQ4JoT\" target=\"_blank\">this new version</a> with bluetooth 5.0 and expanded codec support.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm46\">The Purchase (Finally)</h2>\n<p>After lots of overthinking, I decided that I wanted a twist-lock-style mount. This type of mount requires either a dedicated case or adhering some sort of adapter to the back of your phone. The latter wasn’t an option (the iPhone XS has a glass back) so I surrendered to the case.</p>\n<p>I looked at both the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.quadlockcase.com\" target=\"_blank\">QuadLock</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"SP Connect (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://sp-connect.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SP Connect</a> systems and ultimately selected the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"SP Connect Moto Mount Pro with a bundled case for the iPhone (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://sp-connect.com/collections/motorbike/products/moto-bundle?variant=52406874581\" target=\"_blank\">SP Connect Moto Mount Pro with a bundled case for the iPhone</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vborxjgx88k\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ></iframe></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" > </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The phone can be inserted or removed easily enough with a little fiddling, so I don’t have to use it as my day-to-day phone protection. The most important factor in my decision was the build quality of the mount: QuadLock uses plastic mounts while SP Connect uses aluminum with a vibration dampening system.</p>\n<p>I’m sure plastic works fine for this application but the aluminum makes me feel like the phone is more secure. (And it looks nicer than plastic.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e3692hm47\">First Ride</h3>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1858-1.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1858-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1859.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1859-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p>I put it on the bike a couple of days ago and went for a long ride in Hill Country with some friends.</p>\n<p>Installation was easy and was completed in 5 minutes. I thought I would be able to extend the extension arm over the center of the handlebar mount but there wasn’t enough clearance. In the end, the final location was best anyway – slightly left of handlebar mount. I mounted it in landscape position and can still clearly see all the gauges while riding.</p>\n<p>The twist-lock case connects to the mount quickly and solidly, then you’re ready to ride.</p>\n<p>I used it in the morning to navigate to the meeting spot for our group ride. It was nice to have visual confirmation along with my voice navigation.</p>\n<p>After lunch, we each went our separate ways, so I used the phone for directions home. The battery was nearly dead at the end of the 90 minute ride which I attribute to the screen being continuously turned on.</p>\n<p>My options going forward would be to either leave the screen turned off (which sort of defeats the benefits of a mount) or route power to it. Luckily, my new bike has a USB port under the seat. I just have to figure out how to the best way to hide the cable.</p>\n<p><em>I have no financial relationship with SP United USA and I purchased my own Moto Bundle. Some of the links above point to Amazon. If you buy something from those links, I’ll earn a few cents.</em></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>For our family vacation this Summer, we decided to explore Santa Fe, New Mexico. I thought it would be a fun road trip from Austin, Texas and decided to drive my Long Range Model 3.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I learned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd0\">Routes</h2>\n<p>First, I checked Google Maps to get an estimate of miles and duration. It estimated ~680 miles and 10.5 hours, without breaks.</p>\n<p>Then I visited <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/trips\">Tesla.com/trips</a> to see if it was a feasible trip and Tesla indicated almost 760 miles and 13.5 hours, including 4 stops to Supercharge.</p>\n<p>At that point, I was debating the use of the Tesla for this trip but someone recommended <a href=\"https://abetterrouteplanner.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ABetterRoutePlanner.com</a> (ABRP) so I tried it.</p>\n<p>It really <strong>is</strong> a better route planner taking into account things like State of Charge (SoC) upon leaving, estimated state of charge on arrival, reference speed, max speed, additional weight (passengers + luggage), elevation, wind speed, wind direction, outdoor temperature, road conditions and types of chargers you’d like to use.</p>\n<p>When you load ABRP in the Model 3’s browser, it even shows an option to <em>Send to Tesla Nav</em> – providing you’ve connected your Tesla account to your ABRP account.</p>\n<p>It’s very comprehensive, but I would soon learn that it’s not perfect and can’t realistically take every variable into account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd1\">Departing</h2>\n<p>ABRP recommended that we depart with 90% SoC but we left home with 100% SoC – and it’s a good thing we did. ABRP estimated that we’d arrive in Cisco, TX with 33% charge but even after departing with 100% SoC, we arrived with less than 10%. Given that this was my first real road trip in my Model 3, it created quite a bit of anxiety.</p>\n<p>After that, I ignored ABRP’s recommended departure SoC and charged to 90% or 100% each time.</p>\n<p>My best guess is that I/ABRP didn’t properly account for the weight of the luggage and the outside temperature – it was over 100 degrees each day and we were running the AC constantly. Even with window tint on the sides and rear, the heat from the sun through the windshield was significant. I’ll probably tint the front windshield in the future to help.</p>\n<p>After compensating by “overcharging” for the rest of the trip, we made it to Santa Fe without issue.</p>\n<p>When we arrived, I charged to 90% at the local Supercharger, then headed to our AirBnB. The homeowner had an outdoor outlet on the front porch, close to the driveway, so every night, I would plug-in using my Tesla Mobile Charger and charge to 90%. It was slow of course, but we didn’t do much driving when in Santa Fe so it worked out perfectly. Even better, I didn’t have to visit the Supercharger before we began the return trip home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd2\">Returning</h2>\n<p>I chose a different route on the way home. On the way to Santa Fe, we spent 10+ hours traveling on the first day and around 5 on the second day.</p>\n<p>I decided to break up the trip into two shorter days on the way home and selected a different route.</p>\n<p>Again, this was a mistake.</p>\n<p>ABRP indicated that we could travel from Amarillo, TX to Sweetwater, TX and arrive with a 14% SoC. Based on my earlier experience, I knew this wasn’t going to be accurate. I worked the problem and came up with a solution: we stopped for dinner at the Overton Hotel in Lubbock where they had four Tesla Destination Chargers.</p>\n<p>We charged for almost 2.5 hours while we had a nice, leisurely dinner and added about 110 miles of range.</p>\n<p>We arrived at our hotel (<a href=\"#mcetoc_1e66qi1dh0\" title=\"Footnotes\">where the Supercharger was*</a>) in Sweetwater with plenty of charge to spare.</p>\n<p>Finally, after leaving Sweetwater for Austin, we had a similar scare. We were traveling at the speed limit (75 MPH in Texas) when we received a warning: “Reduce speed to below 75 MPH to arrive at destination.” This is Tesla’s polite way of saying, “Yo! You are going to have to call a flatbed truck to take you to the nearest Supercharger if you don’t conserve your battery.”</p>\n<p>After dropping to 75 MPH, I received the same warning, indicating that I should travel below 60 MPH.</p>\n<p>The car indicated that we would arrive with 9% SoC and as you would expect, I didn’t want to risk it. We ended up driving further South to the Supercharger in Junction, TX where we grabbed a snack and charged to 90% SoC before heading to Austin. It added about an hour to the trip but we were all more relaxed (and cool, since we could run the AC without concern) so it was worth it.</p>\n<p>We arrived home with about 100 miles of estimated range.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd3\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd4\">We need more Superchargers, Elon! 😉</h3>\n<p>This is a common complaint, so I won’t belabor the point – especially when you consider that the <a href=\"https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/supercharger-cost-build\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated cost</a> to build out a Tesla Supercharger station is around $250,000.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd5\">The fuel savings are significant.</h3>\n<p>We estimate that we saved more than $200 compared to driving my wife’s 2016 Toyota Highlander on this trip – even with the slight premium we paid for Supercharging. (Charging at home is typically much less expensive.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd6\">Enter complete data when planning your route.</h3>\n<p>ABRP is a great tool, but if you don’t feed it good data, it can’t accurately – and safely – predict your route. In this instance, I didn’t properly account for actual travel speed, elevations and topography, external temperature (which affects AC usage), wind speed and direction (West Texas is windy as hell – that’s why there are wind farms everywhere), and luggage weight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd7\">A Standard Range Model 3 seems like it’s only good for local driving – for now.</h3>\n<p>I have a Long Range Model 3 and I could barely make it between Superchargers on my route. A Standard Range Model 3 would never have made it. (We need more Superchargers, Elon!) Granted, your route and destination matters – we traveled through the wide expanse of West Texas to get to New Mexico – so it might be different for other destinations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e36a7jvd8\">I would do it again.</h3>\n<p>It was fun but more importantly, I really can’t drive an ICE car anymore. I find it cumbersome. I will drive my Tesla everywhere, range permitting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e66qi1dh0\">Footnotes</h4>\n<p>* Tesla must have cut a nice deal with Holiday Inn as most of the Superchargers we encountered were in Holiday Inn/Express parking lots. Learning what I did on this trip, I will always choose the hotel with the Supercharger, event if it costs a few dollars more. Score for Holiday Inn.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Sometimes, you just need to make a big change in your life to accomplish a goal.</p>\n<p>Since I moved to Austin four years ago, I’ve packed on quite a bit of weight. Some of it was due to stress, some of it was due to inactivity and some of it was due to medication. (My doctor prescribed medication that made me gain 20 pounds in less than a month. I never lost it.)</p>\n<p>I’m not looking to do anything crazy like drop down to my college weight. I just want to be healthy and fit back into my favorite jeans, sweaters and t-shirts.</p>\n<p>In January, I returned to CrossFit after more than a year away due to plantar fasciitis and surgery to fix my sinuses. I’ve been training consistently three days a week plus additional days at the gym. I’ve been consuming less that 2,200 calories per day – sometimes around 1,800 – and have seen zero results.</p>\n<p>Actually, that’s not completely true – I’ve gotten stronger, faster, improved my endurance and lowered my resting heart rate. I just haven’t decreased my girth.</p>\n<p>I finally decided that it might be time to change my diet.</p>\n<p>About 15 years ago, I tried Atkins. It worked pretty well but was difficult and expensive to stay on it for long stretches of time and didn’t work well with my anxiety. Plus, I was doing it alone – my wife wasn’t into it.</p>\n<p>Atkins is similar to a Ketogenic diet, though not quite as strict, so instead of Atkins, my wife and I decided to give Keto a try.</p>\n<p>It’s been about a week of eating high fat, moderate protein and low carbs – sometimes less than 20 grams of carbs per day. The food is delicious and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Jr616e\">the recipes</a> we started with are pretty easy to prepare.</p>\n<p>I was sedentary all last week due to a cold and even so, I’ve noticed a difference already.</p>\n<p>I think this might be the regimen that actually works for me. Time (and persistence) will tell.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I’ll share some of my experiences here.</p>",
