            "content_html": "<p>In my perpetual quest to learn something new and interesting, I gave this blog a complete overhaul.</p>\n<p>For years, I self-hosted it on Wordpress. That was a pain, primarily because (at the time) it was difficult to lock down Wordpress and protect it from getting hacked. Couple that with things like mySQL and PHP updates and stuff was breaking all the time. I spent more time administering it than actually writing.</p>\n<p>I moved it to Squarespace where it ran for a long time without issues until December 2018 when I made a DNS change (at the request of Squarespace) and it made the site unreachable. Squarespace support was of no help in fixing the issue, so I decided to move it to a basic Wordpress.com site using their Squarespace import tool.</p>\n<p>Wordpress.com is great. A fully-managed Personal blog is $4/month and, if you don’t want to use the traditional Wordpress interface, the new management interface is attractive and easy to use.</p>\n<p>Where it started to get annoying was when I wanted to do simple things like customize my CSS or add a Google Analytics tracking tag and found that a Personal plan doesn’t allow for that - you have to upgrade to a Premium plan.</p>\n<p>I get it - it’s SaaS and they have to price it properly to incentivize people to move up to plans with higher ARPU. But I also know that some of these things are trivial to enable and it felt unnecessarily restrictive.</p>\n<p>So, during my <a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/what-i-did-on-my-holiday-staycation-2020-edition/\">Holiday Staycation</a>, I began to explore <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/\">static site generators</a>. Static sites are incredibly fast because there’s no server side processing of web pages - the web server simply delivers a pre-built file. More importantly, there’s no CMS running code so the attack vectors are (generally speaking) only the OS and the web server and not some insecure Wordpress plugin.</p>\n<p>I was reading a lot of Home Assistant docs (another Staycation project) and noticed that they were using <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, so I decided to give it a try. I like the simplicity of page generation using plain text files, markdown and YAML and I found a highly regarded python script to import Wordpress posts so I could migrate my current content to static files.</p>\n<p>After some configuration, the import script worked great, but I was unable to figure out why I couldn’t get any theme other than the default to work. I finally ran out of tinker time and had to go back to the office.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, while my wife was attending a Yoga immersive for the weekend, I started exploring other options. As it turns out, there <a href=\"https://staticsitegenerators.net/\">are <strong>a lot</strong> of static site generators out there</a>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I chose <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\">Publii</a>. It’s an open source static site generator with a full GUI and lots of great features. There’s a built-in utility for Wordpress imports but then, as I was starting the process, I decided to take inventory of the content.</p>\n<p>Much of it is outdated (Review of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treo_755p\">Palm Treo 755p</a>, anyone?) or the equivalent of what would be social media posts today.</p>\n<p>Sure, reviewing old posts was an interesting trip down Memory Lane but in the end, I decided to simply select posts to migrate manually, updating the URL structure and media file references accordingly.</p>\n<p>My intention is to host this on a spare Raspberry Pi on my home network, just so I can learn how to set up things like dynamic DNS, domain-based routing through the firewall and reverse proxy configuration but for now, it’s hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>\n<p>Publii is open source. If you want to support the project, you can contribute code or <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/donate/\">make a donation</a>. I make a monthly donation through <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/publii/\">Open Collective</a> but you can also make a donation via PayPal.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<h2>I had no backup plan.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/review-system76-lemur-pro/\" title=\"Review: System76 Lemur Pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I switched to Pop!_OS as my daily driver </a>but I didn't yet move my files from my old MacBook Pro. Everything was backed up using Mac software, and I didn't have a plan for Linux backup.</p>\n<p>On the Mac, I backed up locally to a 1 TB external USB 3.0 drive using Time Machine and off-site to Dropbox <em>and</em> Amazon S3 using Arq Backup. Yeah, it was overkill, but you can't put a price on data loss, especially 25 years of family photos and videos.</p>\n<p>I also recently built a NAS system on my LAN for our family file storage, but it's not yet ready for backups, so I needed both a short term solution for my Linux laptop and a long term solution that I could use for all of our household backups.</p>\n<p>It doesn't matter what your preferred backup software is but, in general, I follow these basic guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automate</strong> your backups on a regular schedule</li>\n<li>Have a <strong>local copy</strong> of your backups for quick retrieval (USB drive, NAS, etc.)</li>\n<li>Have an <strong>off-site/cloud copy</strong> of your backups for redundancy</li>\n<li>Check the <strong>integrity</strong> of your backups regularly</li>\n<li>Have a recovery <strong>plan</strong>. (Do you know how to recover your data, especially since your backup software was running on your now dead computer?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After investigating a number of backup solutions, including <a href=\"https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"TimeShift on GitHub\">TimeShift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.duplicati.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Duplicati Home\">Duplicati</a>, I decided upon <a href=\"https://duplicacy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Duplicacy Backup Software\">Duplicacy</a>, mostly based upon community reviews.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Duplicacy is developed by <a href=\"https://acrosync.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Acrosync Home\">Acrosync</a>. If you're comfortable working with the command line, there is <strong>no cost for a CLI license</strong> since it's open source. <em>Thanks, Acrosync.</em></p>\n<p>While the core Duplicacy backup engine is open source, the web-GUI version is not, nor is it free. That's fine with me - I'm happy to contribute to open source projects through commercial offerings.</p>\n<p>The pricing for a personal license is a little outside the norm - not quite SaaS, not quite a one-time purchase - but I ended up getting a 5-year license for $40.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">The Duplicacy web-GUI version has a lengthy free trial period, so you have plenty of time to decide if it works for you.</p>\n<p>Here's how to set it up.</p>\n<h2>Wizards and Magic</h2>\n<p>My experience with backup software has typically been wizard-driven:</p>\n<p>[Launch backup software]</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What files would you like to backup?</li>\n<li>Where do you want to put those files?</li>\n<li>Do you want those files to be encrypted?</li>\n<li>How often do you want to backup?</li>\n<li>How long do you want to keep your backups?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[Save]</p>\n<p>After that, everything just backs up automagically.</p>\n<p>Duplicacy addresses all the same considerations, but instead of being wizard-driven, set up is performed using commands and configuration files. Luckily, I could ramp up quickly using the web-GUI version. I'll use this version for my laptop, but will use the command line version for backing up my NAS to the cloud.</p>\n<h2>Concepts</h2>\n<p>To get started with Duplicacy, you first need to understand some concepts and definitions. Again, wizard-driven backup solutions use these same concepts, but they're abstracted. In Duplicacy, they are explicit and uniquely configured. This approach took me a few minutes to get my head around, but now it makes perfect sense.</p>\n<h3>Repository</h3>\n<p>A Repository is the location of the files that you want to backup. (e.g. /home/yourdirectory or /etc/opt)</p>\n<h3>Snapshot ID</h3>\n<p>A Snapshot ID is a unique identifier for the repository you want to backup. For example, if you want to backup your home directory, you might give it a Snapshot ID of \"Home.\"</p>\n<h3>Revision</h3>\n<p>After the first backup of a repository, each subsequent backup generates a Revision. A revision contains the changes (additions, deletions, edits) since the last backup (sometimes referred to as Incremental or Differential backup). Revisions provide faster backups and conserve disk space.</p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>Where will you store your backups? You will need to initialize that storage by providing a path to the local or remote file system. If you're backing up off-site to cloud storage, you'll need to authenticate with that service before you can select it as a backup location. The process of authenticating Duplicacy varies based on the service you're using, so I won't cover that here.</p>\n<p>Currently, Duplicacy supports the following backends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local File System</li>\n<li>SFTP</li>\n<li>Dropbox</li>\n<li>Amazon S3 (or API equivalent)</li>\n<li>Wasabi</li>\n<li>DigitalOcean Spaces</li>\n<li>Google Cloud</li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure</li>\n<li>Backblaze B2</li>\n<li>Google Drive</li>\n<li>Microsoft OneDrive</li>\n<li>Hubic</li>\n<li>OpenStack Swift</li>\n<li>WebDav</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/supported-storage-backends/1107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Storage Backends on the Duplicacy Forum\">You can find details and CLI commands on the Duplicacy Forum.</a></p>\n<p>In my short term use case, I'll be backing up to a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zr7uaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Sandick High Endurance Micro SD Card 256 GB\">High Endurance Micro SD card</a> (Local File System) every few hours and Google Drive each night.</p>\n<p>When my NAS is properly set up, I plan to continue with the Micro SD card for hourly backups, use the NAS for nightly backups and use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Amazon S3 Glacier &amp; S3 Glacier Deep Archive\">Amazon S3 Glacier</a> for weekly off-site backups.</p>\n<h3>Backup</h3>\n<p>A Backup is defined as the collection of files or directories you want to backup and the location where you want to put them. In order to configure a Backup, you first need to have initialized your Storage.</p>\n<h3>Schedule</h3>\n<p>A Schedule contains the timing of your backups (Day, time of day, etc.) and the Backup job you want to run. You can have multiple schedules for the same backup, multiple backups in a single schedule, etc. In order to configure a Schedule, you first need to have initialized your Storage and created at least one Backup.</p>\n<h3>Prune</h3>\n<p>The Prune function is similar to step 5 in the wizard-driven software example above but again, you need to explicitly define it. To do this, you need to create a Schedule that runs a Prune job, select the appropriate Backup, then indicate the parameters for when to start pruning data.</p>\n<h3>Restore</h3>\n<p>You can restore your data from any shapshot contained in your backup library. Keep in mind that these are not bootable system backups - only your data. If your Linux installation doesn't have a bootable recovery partition, you may want to keep a bootable USB drive handy in case of system failure.</p>\n<h3>Additional Concepts</h3>\n<p>There are some additional concepts and commands that you may want to explore, but the above is enough to get you started.</p>\n<h2>Setting up Duplicacy</h2>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>You have two options for installing the Duplicacy web version:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download a self-contained binary or;</li>\n<li>Build it from source.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I selected the easiest option and <a href=\"https://duplicacy.com/download.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Download Duplicacy\">downloaded the binary for x64 systems</a>. Once downloaded, I ran a checksum to ensure that it wasn't corrupted.</p>\n<p><code>cd /home/gadgetboy/Downloads</code></p>\n<p><code>sha256sum duplicacy_web_linux_x64_1.3.0</code></p>\n<p> Next, I moved the application to /opt/Duplicacy</p>\n<p><code>sudo mkdir /opt/Duplicacy</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo mv /home/gadgetboy/Downloads/duplicacy_web_linux_x64_1.3.0 /opt/Duplicacy</code></p>\n<p>You also need to change permissions on the file so that it can be executed as a program. You can do this from the command line or using the Files application by right-clicking the file, selecting <strong>Permissions</strong>, then selecting the checkbox, \"Allow executing file as program.\"</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/duplicacy_permissions_markup.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/responsive/duplicacy_permissions_markup-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/responsive/duplicacy_permissions_markup-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/responsive/duplicacy_permissions_markup-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/responsive/duplicacy_permissions_markup-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Set File as Executable in Files\" width=\"461\" height=\"493\">\n<figcaption >Set executable file permissions (Image Credit: me)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Launching Duplicacy at Startup</h4>\n<p>Even though Duplicacy is now ready to launch, you'll want to do one more thing: make sure Duplicacy launches after a restart.

Yes?</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\"><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've set up the Duplicacy web-GUI version to backup your files automatically.</p>\n<h3>The Check Job</h3>\n<p>You've now setup Duplicacy and performed a successful backup and restore of your data, but do you plan to do that after <em>every</em> backup?</p>\n<p>Of course not.</p>\n<p>To ensure Snapshot integrity, you'll want to run the <strong>Check</strong> command. You can run a Check at any time but it's probably best to schedule a Check job after a completed backup.</p>\n<p>By default, the Check command will only verify that a referenced file chunk exists in your snapshots. If you want to automatically verify the integrity of each individual file, see <a href=\"https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/check-command-details/1081\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Check command details\">this post on the Duplicacy forum</a> for options.</p>\n<p>To setup a Check job, you can create a new schedule or add the job to an existing schedule. In my case, I've added it to my \"Nightly\" schedule so that it runs after each daily cloud backup.</p>\n<p>Once your schedule is created, click the \"<strong>+</strong>\" icon to add a new job. Select <strong>Check</strong> from the drop down menu, then select which <strong>Destination</strong> you want to check.

Then, each night, I backup my home directory to Google Drive. (That's two Storage locations, two Backup jobs and two Schedules, if you're keeping track.)</p>\n<p>I created two daily Prune jobs for each referenced Backup.</p>\n<p>To create a Prune job, select <strong>Schedule</strong> from the toolbar, then select the \"<strong>+</strong>\" icon in the bottom left of the main screen to create a new schedule. In my case, I prune both my local backups and my cloud backups every 7 days. Choose what works for your peace of mind and your storage limitations.</p>\n<p>Give your schedule a logical name such as \"Prune_Local\" or \"Prune_Cloud.\" If you intend to run multiple jobs in the same schedule, name the schedule accordingly.</p>\n<p>Now, find your new schedule in the main screen and select the \"<strong>+</strong>\" icon to add a job to it. This is just like adding the Backup job that we covered above, but instead of selecting <strong>Backup</strong> from the drop down menu, we're going to select <strong>Prune</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/gallery/duplicacy_prune_setup.png\" data-size=\"613x532\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/46/gallery/duplicacy_prune_setup-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Duplicacy Prune Job Setup\" width=\"613\" height=\"532\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Duplicacy Prune Job Setup (Image Credit: me)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Next, select the <strong>Destination</strong> (your initialized Storage) that you want to Prune and configure your <strong>Retention Policy</strong>.

Their original design was to uniquely identify internet users to help ecommerce sites keep track of what items are in your shoppping cart.</p>\n<p>Since then, they've been used for a variety of reasons, almost all of which are designed to <strong>track you on the internet</strong>.</p>\n<p>Cross-site tracking cookies are the worst offenders.</p>\n<p>These cookies are delivered by companies like ad networks, analytics and research providers, social media sites and ecommerce sites, among others.</p>\n<p>Have you ever searched for something on Google, then saw an ad for it on a web site?</p>\n<p>What about Amazon?</p>\n<p>Facebook?</p>\n<p>Twitter?</p>\n<p>eBay?</p>\n<p>All of these companies use this tactic (called \"retargeting\" in ad industry parlance) but the worst part about it is not the relevant ads - that's actually a benefit to you - it's the massive amounts of data that these companies gather about you in the process: what sites you visit, when you use a web application (Hello, \"Login with Facebook\".), what purchases you're considering, what medications you may be taking, any health conditions you may have - the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>You can do some things to help protect your privacy - use a privacy-respecting search engine like DuckDuckGo, turn on \"Do Not Track\" in your browser, install ad blockers in your browser - but if you're really serious about preventing data exhaust, the best thing you can do is to use a different web browser for every site you visit.</p>\n<p>Wait. What?! How is that even possible?!</p>\n<p>It's not. There are too many web sites and not enough browsers to use this strategy. Plus, it would be a huge pain in the ass.</p>\n<p>That's where <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Firefox Multi-Account Containers\">Firefox Multi-Account Containers</a> (\"Firefox Containers\") come to the rescue.</p>\n<h2>Firefox Multi-Account Containers</h2>\n<p>From the Mozilla web site:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/\">Multi-Account Containers</a> is a Firefox add-on that lets you separate your work, shopping or personal browsing without having to clear your history, log in and out, or use multiple browsers. Container tabs are like normal tabs except that the sites you visit will have access to a separate slice of the browser's storage. This means your site preferences, logged in sessions, and advertising tracking data won't carry over to the new container. Likewise, any browsing you do within the new container will not affect your logged in sessions, or tracking data of your other containers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I discovered Firefox containers last year when I began diving back into Linux as it's the default browser installed in many Linux distributions.</p>\n<p>Firefox has always been an excellent browser but over the years, I tended to use browsers that were faster (Safari) or had better plug-in support for the apps that I used (Chrome).</p>\n<p>Firefox containers changed all of that.</p>\n<p>Firefox is now the default browser on my personal machine, the browser I use for personal tasks on my work PC and even the default browser on my Android phone.</p>\n<p>Here's how I configure and use Firefox containers. Feel free to follow along with me.</p>\n<p>I'm assuming that you already have Firefox installed. If not, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Download Firefox\">go ahead and do that</a>. Now, you're ready to get started with Firefox Multi-Account Containers.</p>\n<p>First, you have to <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Download Firefox Multi-Account Containers\">install the add-on from Mozilla</a> since it's not included by default. (It really should be.)</p>\n<p>Once that's done, you'll see a new icon in your toolbar:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/Screenshot-from-2020-04-26-07-20-31.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Screenshot-from-2020-04-26-07-20-31-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Screenshot-from-2020-04-26-07-20-31-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Screenshot-from-2020-04-26-07-20-31-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Screenshot-from-2020-04-26-07-20-31-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Firefox Multi-Account Containers Icon\" width=\"227\" height=\"90\">\n<figcaption >Firefox Multi-Account Containers Icon (Image Credit: me)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Selecting it will show you some sample containers that have already been created for you to use or test.

(Not social media, yet.)</p>\n<p>Next, create a new Default tab using the standard Firefox controls. (\"Ctrl + T\" on Linux and Windows, \"Cmd + T\" on a Mac or clicking the \"+\" icon in the toolbar). Now, visit that same web site again in the Default tab. You'll immediately notice that you're not logged in to the site in that tab.</p>\n<p>That's because Firefox containers have (as the name implies) contained your activities for that web site within the Personal set of tabs (you can have as many container tabs open as your computer will allow). If this is a site that you login to frequently, you can check the box just below the page title in the Firefox containers menu, so that you can \"Always open in Personal.\" By doing that, any time you launch a new tab and enter the URL for that web site, regardless of the container you're using, Firefox will load that web site in the Personal container automatically.</p>\n<p>But wait - it gets better.</p>\n<h2>The Facebook Container</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/facebook_container_icon.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/facebook_container_icon-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/facebook_container_icon-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/facebook_container_icon-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/responsive/facebook_container_icon-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Facebook Container Fence Icon\" width=\"160\" height=\"27\">\n<figcaption >Facebook Container Fence Icon (Image Credit: me)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Now, install the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Facebook Container on Mozilla.org\">Facebook Container</a> add-on. The Facebook Container is a special add-on that not only keeps your Facebook activity in the Firefox container, but it also blocks the loading of any Facebook cookies, code or off-site applications, such as \"Share to Facebook\" or \"Login with Facebook.\"</p>\n<p>Try it: open a tab in any other container, then visit any web site that has Facebook \"Share\" buttons.

They enable me to accomplish things so much faster than navigating through application menus. So, if you're like me, that means you probably create tabs using \"Ctrl + T\" on Linux and Windows or \"Cmd + T\" on a Mac.</p>\n<p>When you do this, you launch a Default tab (and related container) in Firefox. Doing this means that the more frequently you use the Default tab, you're more likely to expose your online activites across sites.</p>\n<h3>Temporary Containers</h3>\n<p>To solve his problem, install the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Temporary Containers Add-on on Mozilla\">Temporary Containers</a> add-on. Next, go to the Add-ons menu item in Firefox, find Temporary Containers, select the ellipse menu, then select Preferences. This add-on is very configurable, but you don't need to worry about that. Select the checkbox for \"Automatic Mode\" then close that tab.</p>\n<p>Automatic Mode, as defined by the add-on creator:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Instantly reopen new tabs in Temporary Containers. You might lose the first few already typed characters in the address bar when reopening takes too long, but it prevents new tabs from writing and reading cookies in the default container.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that the Temporary Containers tab is installed, any time you create a new tab using keyboard shortcuts or use the \"+\" icon on the toolbar, Firefox will create a new Temporary tab. When you close the tab, all of the cookies that were set in that tab will be deleted, erasing any trace of your visit to that site. </p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>Note:</strong> unlike Private Windows, visits to sites in Temporary Containers will still show up in your browser history.</p>\n<p>But what happens if you use a Temporary container and wind up on a site where you have an account and would like to be remembered? Right-click the current tab and select the \"Reopen in Container\" menu, then select your chosen container. You can then select the Firefox containers icon in the toolbar and check the box to always open that site in that container.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/45/reopen_in_container.gif\" alt=\"Reopen in Container Animation\" width=\"386\" height=\"298\">\n<figcaption >Reopen in Container (Image Credit: me)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Go Further</h2>\n<p>If you'd like to take additional steps to protect your privacy (and speed up your web browsing in the process) I recommend installing the following add-ons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"uBlock Origin add-on on Mozilla\">uBlock Origin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Privacy Badger add-on on Mozilla\">Privacy Badger</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>uBlock Origin is a fast ad-blocker that is efficient with resources. It doesn't hog a lot of memory or noticeably slow down your computer.</p>\n<p>Privacy Badger has some similar functionality, but it's main purpose is to automatically learn which sites are tracking you, then block them accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>Note:</strong> like most ad blocking add-ons, these applications can sometimes prevent sites from working properly. If you find yourself in that situation, you can turn off uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger for that site while leaving them turned on for other sites you visit.</p>\n<h2>In Conclusion or \"Who has time for all this?\"</h2>\n<p>When I tell people about my use of Firefox Multi-Account Containers, inevitably, I receive questions like, \"How long did it take you to set this up?\" and \"Who has time for all this?\"</p>\n<p>Set up is easy - you can follow the instructions I've provided above and be done in 5 minutes or less. However, at the start, you do need to think differently about how you use your browser, but that's a short learning curve.</p>\n<p>Installing Temporary Containers helped me a lot here, since I no longer had to worry about accidentally opening something in a permanent Default container.</p>\n<p>I suggest you give it a try. You'll notice a significant drop in the number of re-targeting ads that you receive and that's <strong>the</strong> key indicator that it's working.</p>\n<p>If you find it too complicated for day-to-day use, you can always switch back to your usual browsing habits.</p>\n<h2>Bonus: Protect Your Privacy on Your Smartphone</h2>\n<p>Firefox on iOS doesn't support add-ons - and never will - due to Apple's strict software security model. On Android, the uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger add-ons can be installed, but not Firefox Multi-Account containers. (insert sad face here)</p>\n<p>This can be problematic as it exposes the data exhaust from your mobile browsing, but there are other things you can do to help prevent that.</p>\n<h3>Apps</h3>\n<p>If you use any of the sites mentioned above, all of them have their own apps for your phone. If you need to buy something on Amazon or search for something on Google, use the site's respective app. Generally speaking, any activity in those apps stays in those apps.</p>\n<p>My personal exception to this rule is Facebook. The Facebook app is notorious for not respecting privacy settings, like when you turn off Location Services for the app. Twitter is better, but still aggressive.</p>\n<p>For these sites, I use a separate browser: I installed Brave, a browser that, like Firefox, also helps protect your privacy. The only two sites that I use in Brave?</p>\n<p>Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<p>Those two sites both have very good mobile web experiences and are the only way I can be certain that they're not tracking my location or other web activities.</p>\n<h3>Sensitive Searches</h3>\n<p>I use DuckDuckGo for web searches on both my laptop and smartphone. While I trust DuckDuckGo to not track me all over the web, that doesn't mean that I trust the sites to which it links.</p>\n<p>For this, I sometimes use the nuclear option for sensitive searches: <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Firefox Focus on Mozilla\">Firefox Focus</a>, a browser that clears everything from your device (including history) when the app is closed. It's available on both Android and iOS and, in practice, functions like the Temporary Containers add-on I described above.</p>\n<p>I use this when I'm searching for things that I don't want anyone to attribute to me. For example, a new cholesterol medication or mortgage refinancing rates. The first search and subsequent site visits to the sites in the search results may expose the fact that I have high cholesterol (I don't) and that's health data that no one needs to know, other than my doctor. The second protects me from incessant retargeting by mortgage lenders and brokers.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It's an awesome machine that's a joy to type on and, with a 32 GB RAM kit and NVIDIA Graphics, it's screaming fast. The trackpad is pretty damn good, too, and the aluminium shell feels and looks great. It supports two NVMe drives and yet another 2.5\" mass storage drive (SSD, Hybrid or Hard Drive). It's a beautiful beast that won't break the bank.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/inspiron_7591.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/inspiron_7591-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/inspiron_7591-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/inspiron_7591-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/inspiron_7591-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Dell Inspiron 15 7591\" width=\"1140\" height=\"473\">\n<figcaption >Image Credit: Dell</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Full Disclosure: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfederico/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"John Federico on LinkedIn.com\">I work for Dell</a> running software partnerships, making this post a little...uncomfortable to write. I'm not involved in the hardware side of the business in any way other than I can sometimes get my hands on some machines before they're released to the <a href=\"#mcetoc_1e5km0bsc0\" title=\"Footnotes\">public*</a>.) <span data-offset-key=\"7su1a-0-0\">😉</span></p>\n<p>I was generally in love with the 7591, but there was just one problem with it: I couldn't get it to properly run any flavor of Linux. Even though the machine is <a href=\"https://certification.ubuntu.com/hardware/201903-26880\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell Inspiron 15 7591 Ubuntu Certification\">Ubuntu Certified</a> (which is a key reason I chose it), I couldn't get the PCI sound card to work. USB audio input and output both worked fine, but troubleshooting the built-in sound card was an exercise in frustration.</p>\n<p>I think we all take for granted that our laptops can play sound until you find yourself trying to learn something from a YouTube video and have to switch to a different PC or your smartphone.</p>\n<p>Since the machine didn't ship with Ubuntu pre-installed, I was unable to get support from Dell. Look, I get it: successfully supporting millions of consumers (many of them not very tech savvy) is no small feat. If you buy a new car, then completely replace the engine with something else, you can't expect the manufacturer to support it. This appears to be industry wide, not just at Dell. (Though, I will ask, why bother certifying a PC for Ubuntu if you're not going to support it with that OS? But, I digress...)</p>\n<p>The Pop!_OS and Ubuntu communities are great resources, but I finally gave up after three weeks and sold it on eBay. The shop where I bought the 32 GB RAM kit won't accept returns unless the memory is DOA and I didn't feel like negotiating the restocking fee on the PC, nor create a support incident for the Dell support team to deal with - with so many people working from home now, they are likely overwhelmed. It was easier to just restore the Windows 10 OS factory image and sell it as \"New, Open Box.\"</p>\n<p>So, even as I returned to my 13\" machine, I was trying to figure out my options. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a PC that wasn't my daily driver, I wasn't willing to buy a similar machine and hope for a better trackpad and, most importantly, I didn't want to have to wrestle with a PC from any major OEM to get Linux running on it. Even users of Thinkpads, which are famously great for supporting Linux across the product line, were having issues getting Ubuntu to run properly on models that I would have considered.</p>\n<p>I wanted a Linux machine with hardware support out of the box, but any device with Linux pre-installed from a major PC OEM is typically sold as a \"<a href=\"#mcetoc_1e5km0bsc0\" title=\"Footnote\">Developer Edition*</a>,\" which means it's <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/overview/cp/linuxsystems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell Project Sputnik\">built - and priced - for business use</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/System76-System76_Logo_Blue-by_Kate_Hazen_of_System76.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/System76-System76_Logo_Blue-by_Kate_Hazen_of_System76-xs.jpg 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/System76-System76_Logo_Blue-by_Kate_Hazen_of_System76-sm.jpg 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/System76-System76_Logo_Blue-by_Kate_Hazen_of_System76-md.jpg 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/System76-System76_Logo_Blue-by_Kate_Hazen_of_System76-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"System76 Branded Desktop Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></figure>\n<p>So, I started searching for other PC's with Linux pre-installed and, not surprisngly, System76 kept popping up with great reviews and a huge community of super fans.

(Probably only a day or so, if I'm being honest with myself.) About a week later, while I was literally dealing with the frustration of using the trackpad on my current machine, I received an email from System76 informing me that I could place one of the first orders for a Lemur Pro. (True to their word, only customers who showed early interest could configure and order one. Random web site visitors had to wait another day or so. That impressed me.)</p>\n<p>I configured and ordered a Lemur Pro with 40 GB RAM and a 512 GB NVMe drive. (I can still add another NVMe drive, if I have a need for it.)</p>\n<p>The next morning, I received both a friendly email and a phone call from System76, letting me know that my order was processed and that it was in the production queue. (Each System76 machine is built-to-order.) 24 hours later, I received another email message telling me that my machine was built and on its way to me via UPS.</p>\n<p>My Lemur Pro arrived four days later. UPS required a signature for delivery but I was able to just flash my ID through the glass on our front door and the driver left it on the porch - a perfect COVID-19, no-contact delivery.</p>\n<h2>Unboxing</h2>\n<h3>First Impressions</h3>\n<p>I'm not going to lie: when I was exploring Linux distros, one of the reasons I was attracted to Pop!_OS was the brand messaging, desktop graphics and overall user experience of the OS. I found their packaging to be consistent with that and right on-brand. </p>\n<p>In what appears to be taking a queue from Apple, System76 ships the device secured in a reusable plastic-and-cardboard mechanism. It's worth keeping around in case you need to ship your machine for service or maybe want to sell it in the future.</p>\n<p>The envelope containing System76 and Pop!_OS stickers was a nice touch.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a

current MacBook Pro but weighs <em>less.</em> <strong>I</strong>t's also ligher than the current MacBook Air and even ligher than the amazing <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-7390-2-in-1-laptop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"XPS 7391 on Dell.com\">XPS 13\" 7391</a> that I use every day at work. (Though, to be fair, the 7391 is a 2-in-1 and has some added weight due to the touchscreen and sophisticated hinge mechanism.)</p>\n<p>The Lemur Pro is so light that I can load both my work machine <em>and</em> my personal machine into my backpack and not even realize that I'm carrying two PC's. Even better, both machines can be powered by USC Type-C Power Delivery, so I only have to carry one charger. This will be great for business trips, when I want to work on personal projects after hours or watch movies on the plane.</p>\n<p>The design is the same as what you would expect from any top-tier PC OEM. It has clean lines and relatively modern design touches. The System76 logo on the lid appears to be laser etched.</p>\n<p>The biggest and most obvious design decision was the webcam. Rather than increase the size of the bezel, System76 decided to add a small bump above the screen to house the camera and built-in microphone. It's not distracting at all when using the machine, but obviously protrudes by a few millimeters when the lid is closed. I'm hoping that the chassis will adequately protect it during transit.</p>\n<p>For some unknown reason, System76 made the decision to place the power button on the right<strong> side</strong> of the machine, not on the keyboard deck. Depending on your perspective, this could be a poor design choice, something to just get used to, or both.</p>\n<p>During my first full day of using the Lemur Pro, I plugged-in a USB Type-C cable with Power Delivery and DisplayPort (which is on the left side) so that I could use it with my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2K9NA6f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell U3818DW\">38\" Dell display</a> to get some work done. Naturally, since the machine is so light, I braced it with my right hand and accidentally pushed the power button, putting it into Suspend mode. I definitely need to remember that in the future.</p>\n<h3>Materials &amp; Build Quality</h3>\n<p>At the time this post is written, System76 doesn't indicate what materials are used to build the Lemur Pro chassis on its web site. While looking at the photos during the buying process, I guessed that it was a nice, Thinkpad-like plastic or some kind of aluminum or magnesium alloy.</p>\n<p>After it arrived, I realized it was metal but didn't know what kind, so I asked the System76 support team and they responded almost immediately:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Hello John,<br><br>Glad you're enjoying the Lemur Pro! The chassis is made out of Magnesium-Aluminum alloy: 9% Aluminum, 90% Magnesium, 1% other material. (Before you ask, I do not know what the \"other material\" is; I assume our supplier simply includes that as a tolerance.) Please let us know if you have any other questions! --Jacob</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Thanks, Jacob.</em></p>\n<p>The Magnesium-Aluminum alloy is smooth to the touch and in my short time using it, appears to reject fingerprints. (Though, System76 includes a microfiber cloth with the system, so perhaps this is a premature observation.) It has tiny reflective flecks of material that only appear in the right light and from the right perspective. This may be a conscious design choice or just a natural charateristic of the alloy. Those flecks might also be the \"1% other material\" but I'm just guessing.</p>\n<p>Fit and finish are excellent with no visible gaps or imperfections. There is no flexing of the chassis or the keyboard deck - it's a solid typing experience. In fact, it's one of the best keyboards I've used in a long time, almost on par with my 2015 MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>The bottom panel flexes a wee bit but it doesn't detract from the overall build quality of the machine. I've only noticed it when I close the lid and grip the PC with one hand.</p>\n<p>The 14.1\" 1080p screen has a matte finish and is bright, crisp and seemingly color accurate. The Lemur Pro's screen is pleasingly larger than my 13\" devices and the form factor is just about perfect.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Even though it would be nice to have a larger screen on-the-go, I recently discovered that the tradeoffs of a 15.6\" machine just aren't worth it - especially the keyboard layout.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">I don't understand why just about every PC OEM feels the need to fill the keyboard deck of larger devices with a number pad, shifting the trackpad and keyboard to the left. It's an awkward experience. Instead of the number pad, why not center the keyboard and add front-firing speakers on each side or maybe just a fingerprint reader that <em>actually works</em> more than 20% of the time? Anyone who really needs a number pad can get one from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XENFXu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"USB Numbers Pads on Amazon.com\">Amazon for less than $20</a>.</p>\n<h4>Trackpad</h4>\n<p>The trackpad on this machine is excellent. Is it as good as a MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS? Not quite, but it's pretty damn close. The fact that it doesn't have buttons is a real plus.</p>\n<h4>Power Supply</h4>\n<p>From the perspective of portability, the power supply is great.

Spec-for-spec, it certainly doesn't pack the horespower of the Dell Inspiron 7591 I gave up.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">The Dell Inspiron 7591 has a 9th Gen Intel i7 in the \"H\" spec (high performance) with 6 cores - 12 threads, 12 MB cache and burst mode up to 4.5 GHz. More importantly, it has a dedicated NVIDIA GPU which helps render video faster. (And improves gaming performance, but I'm not much of a gamer.)</p>\n<p>With that said, the Lemur Pro defintely punches above its weight. It's surprisingly fast for its specs and the onboard Intel GPU works well, powering both the built-in display and my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cwwFXN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Dell U3818DW Curved Display\">large (3840 x 1600) external display</a> simultaneously. Video playback and video conferences are smooth and consistent.</p>\n<p>It quickly renders web pages in Firefox, which is typically a small step behind the speed of the Chromium and WebKit rendering engines.</p>\n<p><strong>GeekBench</strong></p>\n<p>Running Geekbench5, the Lemur Pro scored better in Multi-core tests than the Intel 8th Gen U series processor in a Dell Inspiron 7386, but lower in Single-core tests. You can see the full results of the Lemur Pro test <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/1817319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"GeekBench Scores for the System76 Lemur Pro\">here</a> and the Dell test <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/1717304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"GeekBench 5 test results for the Dell Inspiron 7386\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/geekbench.png\" data-size=\"886x143\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/gallery/geekbench-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"GeekBench5 results on my System76 Lemur Pro\" width=\"768\" height=\"124\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">GeekBench5 results on my System76 Lemur Pro</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Here's the obiligatory screenshot of HTOP running in a terminal window.

During those instances, I was installing multiple package updates from Pop!_Shop or running a video conference in Zoom.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the machine runs quite cool. I can barely feel any excess heat when it's on my lap during general use. (I'm sure I might have a different experience if I was rendering a 4K video with compositing while sitting on the couch.)</p>\n<h4>RAM</h4>\n<p>Do I really need 40 GB of RAM for a machine that I'm using for hobby projects?</p>\n<p>Generally, no.</p>\n<p>While I do some light video production, photo editing and vector art production, I use my machine mostly for office work, Raspberry Pi and other SBC projects, managing my home lab and testing home automation scripts. </p>\n<p>But I want to <strong>fly</strong> through my workflows. When I'm in The Zone, I don't want to deal with a lagging OS. Having excess memory ensures that the OS almost never has to write anything to the swap partition on the disk. (Also referred to as \"Virtual RAM.\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Virtual RAM on Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n<p>Plus, maxing out the RAM ensures that the machine will have a long service life without much effort, and the additional memory improves its resale value should I decide to upgrade to a new machine in the future.</p>\n<h4>Storage</h4>\n<p>My preferred configuration is to have a small (&lt;250 GB) NVMe drive for the OS and a second, larger NVMe drive for my /home directory and files. However, after lots of shopping around, it doesn't appear that the smaller NVMe drives even come close to the performance of those that are 500 GB or larger, which is an important consideration for the OS drive.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I selected the smallest, fastest NVMe drive available during system configuration for both the OS and my files - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VchDk4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Samsung EVO Pro\">a 512 GB Samsung EVO Pro</a>. I could have gotten a 1 TB drive with the same read/write specs, but most of my larger media files are stored on NAS on my LAN, and in the cloud. I can upgrade to a larger drive or add a second drive at a later time, if I need it.</p>\n<h4>Networking</h4>\n<p>The Lemur Pro uses the onboard Intel networking controller with the 802.11ac spec and speeds up to 867 Mbps. I have other machines with 802.11ac but this feels much snappier, perhaps because web pages render so quickly. File transfers over SAMBA, SFTP, NFS and HTTPS also seem very fast.</p>\n<h4>Battery Life</h4>\n<p>If you've read this far, you know that I am not a professional PC reviewer so I had to improvise the battery life evaluation.</p>\n<p>Here's what I did:</p>\n<p>I unplugged the machine from the power supply and spent 4 hours writing this post, responding to email, watching YouTube tutorials on how to optimize OpenMediaVault and NextCloud, downloading software, and connecting with friends and family on social media.</p>\n<p>I didn't do any video rendering or stream a ton of HD video, and I didn't compile any code. Basically, I just used it like an average consumer.</p>\n<p>At the end of the 4 hours, my battery was at 91%. Pop!_OS indicated that I still had over 20 hours of use. The Pop!_OS power management profile was set to \"Balanced.\"</p>\n<p>It's not a scientific benchmark, but it should give you some idea about the battery life of the Lemur Pro: it's remarkable.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/power_after_4_hours.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/power_after_4_hours-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/power_after_4_hours-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/power_after_4_hours-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/43/responsive/power_after_4_hours-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Power Indicator after 4 hours\" width=\"327\" height=\"445\">\n<figcaption >Power indicator after 4 hours of use. (Image Credit: me)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Eventually, I'll get a feel for how the battery life holds up under heavier loads.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I provided my opinion of this laptop based on my specific needs using my own decision making criteria. However, I'm hoping that based on my experience, you can get a sense of how well it might work for you.</p>\n<h3>Positives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Premium specs, look and feel</li>\n<li>Light, Magnesium-Alloy chassis</li>\n<li>Bright, color-accurate, matte-finish 1080p screen </li>\n<li>Solid keyboard with good key travel</li>\n<li>Ample ports</li>\n<li>USB Type-C Power Delivery with Display Port</li>\n<li>Powerful CPU that runs cool during general use</li>\n<li>Quiet fans</li>\n<li>Excellent trackpad performance</li>\n<li>Pop!_OS (of course)</li>\n<li><em>Complete hardware support</em> for Pop!_OS</li>\n<li>An envelope full of cool stickers <span data-offset-key=\"7su1a-0-0\">😉</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Neutrals:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Slight chassis flex in certain use cases</li>\n<li>Camera bump on the top screen bezel</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Negatives:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Poorly placed power button</li>\n<li>The power supply cables are waaayyy too short</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Lemur Pro and am now wondering why I didn't buy a System76 machine sooner.</p>\n<p>Do you have a Lemur Pro?

He’d never installed one of these before and had <strong>only watched a YouTube video</strong>. I immediately lost confidence.</p>\n<p>And, boy, was I right.</p>\n<p>Step number one in any job like this: label all your wires before you pull everything apart. Even though there were supposed to be six zones, he labelled only three wires – and they were all labelled incorrectly. In fact, he installed the <strong>AC power</strong> and <strong>siren</strong> connections as zones. (Thankfully, I had already disconnected the power or he would have fried the unit.)</p>\n<p>I had to remove the old alarm system while he was <strong>reading the documentation on his phone</strong> and talking to his manager because he thought he was going to install a <strong>wireless</strong> system in the existing steel box. <strong>Nothing</strong> about the Retrofit Kit worked when he left. His “manager was going to call me to reschedule” but that never happened.</p>\n<p>I contacted them for a refund and they were supposed to get back to me “in the morning.” That also never happened. I finally disputed the charge with my credit card issuer.</p>\n<p>The next day, I ended up pulling apart his mess and installing the system myself. It took me about an hour. But what I discovered during the installation process <strong>really</strong> pissed me off.</p>\n<p>When we bought the house, the alarm was pre-installed during construction. (The best time to do it, natch.) The installers wired everything to a <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"DSC PC1616 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.dsc.com/index.php?n=products&amp;o=view&amp;id=1\" target=\"_blank\">DSC PC1616</a> – a six zone alarm system. However, there are <strong>20</strong> wired zones. They spliced numerous zones into single zone ports on the alarm system and just labelled them “Garage-Office-Dining Room-Back Door.”</p>\n<p>It was a total clusterf*ck.</p>\n<p>First, because it was a <strong>hack</strong> and second, because the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit runs on Lithium batteries – and there isn’t nearly enough power to activate and monitor multiple zones on a single circuit.</p>\n<p>Since each Retrofit Alarm Kit only has eight zones, I ended up having to buy a second unit so that I could properly wire each zone. For those of you doing the math at home, yes, there will be a few zones that aren’t wired, but all of them require a thirty-foot ladder to get near them, so I feel comfortable leaving them that way, for now. I may grab a third unit when they go on sale in the future, just to make sure all zones are wired.</p>\n<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>\n<p>My final configuration will be to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028205592-Using-Alexa-Guard-with-Alarm-to-Detect-Broken-Glass-Smoke-and-Carbon-Monoxide\" target=\"_blank\">set up our Echo devices with Alexa Guard to act as glass break, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors</a>. (We own five Echo Dots and a Sonos Play One, though only the Echo devices support this feature.) This is a huge bonus – I don’t have to buy any additional hardware** to let the monitoring station know which sensor is triggered. If no one responds to the safety check, they’ll simply send the appropriate emergency service to the house.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of the whole set up is the remote access. We can now arm and disarm every sensor in the system from our smartphones wherever we are and also grant access to friends and family by giving them a temporary passcode. The convenience is great.</p>\n<p>The icing on the proverbial cake?</p>\n<p>The professional monitoring from Ring is half the cost of monitoring from my existing service provider – and I didn’t have to pay extra for the cellular hardware. The purchase of the Ring products will almost pay for themselves in the <s>first</s> second year and the system includes all the convenience we’ve been waiting for.</p>\n<p>I’ll unload the old system on eBay or Facebook Marketplace.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<h4>Footnotes</h4>\n<p>*Only 8 zones are supported.</p>\n<p>**If you don’t have an Echo device, you can purchase <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://amzn.to/35l5LyL\" target=\"_blank\">a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms</a> and send the appropriate trigger to the monitoring station.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When my son started at his new school, he needed a conventional PC. After finding him a 2015 MacBook Air in perfect condition for a veritable steal on eBay, I adopted his Chromebook – a Dell Inspiron 3180 with an 11.6 inch screen, Intel Celeron processor, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of eMMC storage.</p>\n<p>I enjoy using it. It runs for 8 or 9 hours on a charge, it has a beautiful HD-ish touch screen and it allows me to install Android apps. These Android apps are treated just like apps on a smartphone, allowing me to access my corporate email and connect to Skype for Business.</p>\n<p>I recently used it on a trip to New York City and it fit well on the tray table in United Economy class and was speedy on the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>For context, I’ve been using Mac OS X exclusively since OS X Jaguar was released in 2002. I had the privilege of either working for myself or bringing my own device to work, so Mac OS was my daily driver and I became proficient in using it and the software designed for it. That changed in January 2018 when I began working for a large company that standardized on Windows 10 PC’s.</p>\n<p>While I still have my 2015 MacBook Pro, my interest in the Chromebook was more about daily, personal use – email, social media, writing, watching videos, doing research – and less about the things I used to do on my Mac which included more advanced workflows like image editing and audio and video production.</p>\n<p>After a couple of months, I found the screen on the Chromebook just a wee bit too small and the processor just a wee bit too slow to render web pages and web apps like Office 365 Online (needed for my work), so I started exploring modern Linux distributions.</p>\n<h2>Like coming home – only more modern</h2>\n<p>Linux is not new to me. I started running Linux under <a href=\"http://www.slackware.com/announce/1.0.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Slackware 1.0</a> and had to build a custom PC just to use it, since so few components were supported in the early 90’s. A lot has changed since then.</p>\n<p>I decided to experiment with Linux on a more powerful <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LvmZ4y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">2-in-1 Dell Inspiron 7000</a> device. It’s a great design with a beautiful high resolution Gorilla Glass screen, aluminium body, i7 processor, 16 GB RAM and a lot more storage.</p>\n<p>My first few attempts at installation (<a href=\"https://www.linuxmint.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Linux Mint</a>) were challenging. This PC is designed to run Windows 10 and there were some BIOS configuration changes I had to figure out in order to convince the machine that it could install Linux instead of Windows.</p>\n<p>After a lot of Googling and even more trial and error, I finally got Linux Mint installed. It’s a vastly better experience than Windows and much more powerful than an off-the-shelf Chromebook. When it comes down to it, I use it for the same tasks as the Chromebook, except I’m not limited to Chrome OS and browser apps – I can run software applications natively in the OS.</p>\n<p>I don’t see myself giving up my Mac for a Linux machine for tasks like video editing, podcasting or image editing, but I don’t do those things very often any more. But, with a Linux installation, I have the option to occasionally perform those tasks whereas those options were limited in Chrome OS.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, I felt that Linux Mint was <em>too much</em> like Windows and just didn’t feel like the Chromebook or Mac OS experiences I prefer, so I started looking at other desktop environments.</p>\n<p>After exploring vanilla Ubuntu, Elementary OS and Plasma 5, I finally settled on <a href=\"https://pop.system76.com/docs/difference-between-pop-ubuntu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Pop!_OS from System76</a>.</p>\n<p>The experience is wonderful – it’s well designed, roomy and feels much more like the elegant experience I’m used to on the Mac. The GNOME-based desktop environment is simple and uncluttered and the speed at which apps perform and web pages load is even faster than my MacBook Pro. (I guess that’s obvious given that the Mac has specs from 2015, but still.)</p>\n<p>System maintenance is even more like a Mac. For instance, like Mac OS and Windows 10, the OS lets me know when there are software updates available and prompts me to upgrade. All I have to do is enter my credentials and the OS takes care of everything for me. In the “good old days” of using Linux, I had to monitor the web and Usenet for software updates, then download and compile them from source code.</p>\n<p>Those days are gone.</p>\n<p>There’s also an “app store” called Pop!_Shop where you can find a curated catalog of commonly used Linux software. Again, all updates are managed by the OS, just like Mac OS or Windows 10.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\">\n<figcaption >Pop! Shop</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Why not just get a new Mac or a faster Chromebook?</h2>\n<p>A new Mac is overkill for my personal computing needs. I love my MacBook Pro and would be happy to be able to use it as my daily driver again, but I don’t see that happening any time soon.</p>\n<p>A faster Chromebook would serve my usual needs, but why spend just about as much on a high-performance Chromebook to only have the limited functionality of Chrome OS? (Comparison: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38dSQR2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Google PixelBook</a> vs. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2s3JTJt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Dell Inspiron 7000</a>)</p>\n<p>A Linux laptop running Pop!_OS fits squarely in between an under-powered, education-oriented Chromebook and a new MacBook at a much more competitive price. I get high-performance access to my cloud services but can also occasionally run <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Gimp</a> for image editing or <a href=\"https://www.openshot.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">OpenShot</a> for a quick video edit.</p>\n<p>My biggest complaint has been battery life. Again, the battery performance claims for this machine are based on Windows 10 with drivers designed specifically for this hardware. It took me a bit of Googling to learn about modern Linux battery management before I could get the machine to run longer than a couple of hours on a charge. In addition to the Pop!_OS battery management tools (which are pretty good), I eventually installed <a href=\"https://www.tecmint.com/tlp-increase-and-optimize-linux-battery-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">TLP</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/09/tlpui-is-graphical-user-interface-for.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">TLPGUI</a> for more advanced battery management. After a few weeks of use with this setup, I’ve found battery life to be more than acceptable.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/tlpgui.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/responsive/tlpgui-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/responsive/tlpgui-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/responsive/tlpgui-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/responsive/tlpgui-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"772\">\n<figcaption >TLP GUI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Is this setup right for you?</h2>\n<p>If you’re like me and most of your personal computing is cloud-based (or could be), I think you’d be surprised how much of your needs can be met by a set up like this.</p>\n<p>Sure, you might not want to go through the hassle of tweaking the BIOS settings to get Linux to install, but really, once that’s done, installation is just like Mac OS or Windows 10. (<a href=\"https://system76.com/laptops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">You could also buy a machine preloaded with Pop!_OS from System76</a> but that option is not as attractive – both in cost and design – as a PC from a major OEM.)</p>\n<p>If you prefer Mac OS-style computing, you can install a desktop environment that looks and behaves almost exactly like the Mac. Ditto for Windows. You can run your favorite browser (<a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/microsoft-edge-linux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">even if your favorite browser is Microsoft Edge</a>) to work with G Suite, Office 365 Online – even Apple iCloud.</p>\n<p>That’s because <strong>using</strong> Pop!_OS is easy. If I set up a PC for my wife running Pop!_OS, she could complete her usual tasks with almost no learning curve. But she’s definitely not the sort of person to figure out how to get the PC to accept the installation. It’s not her thing.</p>\n<p>Maybe there’s a cottage industry in setting up user-friendly Linux installations on a device that a customer already owns? Probably not enough mass appeal there, but it’s an interesting idea.</p>\n<p>If you want a quick run through of Pop!_OS you can watch the short video below. There are plenty of others on YouTube but they’re mostly reviews by Linux geeks, for Linux geeks.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4TAm9PGvbw\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>",

            "summary": "I have a history with vacuums. When I was 11 years old,&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p>I have a history with vacuums.</p>\n<p>When I was 11 years old, I disassembled the vacuum to see how the parts worked, then rushed to put it back together before my Mom got home. (It still worked.) From that experience, my brother nicknamed me Gadgetboy, so this post is quite fitting.</p>\n<p>When my wife and I moved our family to Austin, we ended up buying a ginormous house, partly because my wife and I both needed home offices, partly because we like this community and couldn’t wait for a more suitably sized house to be built, since we had to enroll our son for the new school year.</p>\n<p>We haven’t regretted our purchase, except for the one thing we didn’t consider: cleaning it.</p>\n<p>Cleaning a house of this size is an all-day affair for two adults. We finally admitted defeat and hired someone to do it a couple of times a month, but that’s still not enough – especially when there are two teenagers, two adults and two dogs living here. The dark wood floors ultimately get covered in tumble weeds of dog hair mixed with crumbs from dog treats.</p>\n<p>My wife and I both work crazy hours and the last thing we want to do is have to clean again in between cleaning service, so I began exploring robot vacuums.</p>\n<p>For years, the only good robot vacuum was a Roomba. It was crazy expensive and never quite as good as a traditional vacuum, but a lot has changed in the past few years. You can find a decent robot vacuum for around $200 these days which will work fine for a small house or apartment.</p>\n<p>But our needs are a little different. We needed something that could clean our ground floor relatively quickly and consistently. But before I share my experience, let me give you a quick rundown of considerations when buying one of these suckers.</p>\n<p>What’s important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suction power</li>\n<li>Battery life</li>\n<li>Bin size</li>\n<li>Ability to work on hard floors and carpet</li>\n<li>Warranty</li>\n<li>Repairability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s about it.</p>\n<p>(If you really want to geek out when shopping for a robot vacuum, visit the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvavJlMjlTd4wLwi9yKCtew\">Vacuum Wars YouTube channel</a>. Yes, that’s a thing.)</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, there is one critical and sometimes overlooked feature of a robot vacuum, especially for larger homes.</p>\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<p>There are basically two types of navigation: the random, bumping-around-the-house-until-it’s-clean type, and the more intelligent, S-patterned type.</p>\n<p>Inexpensive robot vacuums will basically just bounce off of objects around your home until its onboard software determines that it has covered the area it’s supposed to clean. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but in larger homes, it can take a long time, especially since it will vacuum over spots it has already cleaned until it has completely covered the floor. This approach also makes it more likely that the robot needs to return to the dock to recharge during a session, extending the completion time even further.</p>\n<p>Also, as part of any navigation system, you’ll want to be able to block the vacuum from going to certain places like, say, your kids playroom or keeping the vacuum from falling down stairs. Inexpensive vacuums can do this but they usually require the placement of some sort of signalling tape that you place around your home. It’s not the most attractive option.</p>\n<p>If you want to clean larger spaces more quickly, you need more advanced navigation. That’s where the S-patterned approach comes in.</p>\n<p>The first time this type of vacuum goes about its business, it will behave more-or-less like the navigation described above. After that, it has captured a map of your home in its onboard software and that’s where things get interesting – and faster.</p>\n<p>Once the robot knows the basic layout of your home, it will begin to vacuum floors in a regular back-and-forth motion until it has reached the end of the room, then it will switch to another room and repeat the process until all of your designated floors are clean.</p>\n<p>After researching robot vacuums (and watching <em>way</em> too many Vacuum Wars videos) I decided that this type of navigation was the best option for us.</p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI\">Roborock S5 </a>went on sale (and I had a bunch of Amazon affiliate earnings banked) I made the purchase.</p>\n<h2>Meet Rosie</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//roborock_s5.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-xs.jpg 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-sm.jpg 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-md.jpg 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"RoboRock S5\" width=\"930\" height=\"1024\">\n<figcaption >RoboRock S5</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Setting up the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI\">Roborock S5</a> was easy as pie. I unboxed it, plugged in the charger and placed it in its new home. While it was charging, I set up the mobile app (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mi-home-xiaomi-smarthome/id957323480\">Mi Home</a>) on my iPhone and connected the robot to my Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>As part of the process, I had the option to name it.</p>\n<p>I named it Rosie.</p>\n<p>For those of my generation, you’ll remember Rosie, the robot house keeper from The Jetsons. It’s a perfect, geeky, nostalgic name choice.</p>\n<p>When it was fully charged, I gave it a go.</p>\n<p>During its first run, it had a difficult time getting itself up onto the high-pile area rug in the living room and a few times, I realized that I forgot to put away the dog toys or slippers, so I had to run around the house to pick those up. Other than that, it did a nice job of cleaning the floors.</p>\n<p>The second time I ran it, I got the following results.<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/img-2004.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-xs.jpg 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-sm.jpg 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-md.jpg 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"Floor Map\" width=\"650\" height=\"1023\"></figure>\n<p>The yellow dot is Rosie’s home, in the dining room, next to the sideboard.</p>\n<p>Notice the S-pattern throughout the house in almost every room.

Is it shared with anyone? Do employees have access to it? Does it know my location?</p>\n<p>I decided to find out.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cnbj1.fds.api.xiaomi.com/html/en/mihome_use_agreement.html\">Terms of Service</a></h2>\n<p>The Terms of Service are pretty much what you’d expect, except for a few concerning items.</p>\n<p><code>5.5.

Rosie becomes a door stop.</p>\n<p><code>VII. Amendment</code></p>\n<p><code>7.1. Xiaomi has the right to amend the terms of this Agreement \nwhen necessary, and any such amended terms will be published on relevant\n web pages.

Xiaomi and its Partner will do their utmost to notify the\n User of any amendments or changes by email or other means.</code></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Things that were once free may become premium (paid) services. If I prefer not to pay these fees, Rosie becomes a door stop.</p>\n<p><code>VIII. Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution</code></p>\n<p><code>8.1. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be\n governed by the laws of the Mainland of the People's Republic of China.\n In the absence of relevant legal provisions, international business \npractices and/or business practices may be used as references.</code></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Do I feel like Xiaomi has breached this agreement or is at fault for something?
