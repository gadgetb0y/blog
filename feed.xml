                    <img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/system76-unleash_your_robot_blue-by_kate_hazen_of_system76-e4dcb9252f.png" alt="System76 Pop!_OS Desktop Image" />
                <p>When my son started at his new school, he needed a conventional PC. After finding him a 2015 MacBook Air in perfect condition for a veritable steal on eBay, I adopted his Chromebook – a Dell Inspiron 3180 with an 11.6 inch screen, Intel Celeron processor, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>I enjoy using it. It runs for 8 or 9 hours on a charge, it has a beautiful HD-ish touch screen and it allows me to install Android apps. These Android apps are treated just like apps on a smartphone, allowing me to access my corporate email and connect to Skype for Business.</p>
<p>I recently used it on a trip to New York City and it fit well on the tray table in United Economy class and was speedy on the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>For context, I’ve been using Mac OS X exclusively since OS X Jaguar was released in 2002. I had the privilege of either working for myself or bringing my own device to work, so Mac OS was my daily driver and I became proficient in using it and the software designed for it. That changed in January 2018 when I began working for a large company that standardized on Windows 10 PC’s.</p>
<p>While I still have my 2015 MacBook Pro, my interest in the Chromebook was more about daily, personal use – email, social media, writing, watching videos, doing research – and less about the things I used to do on my Mac which included more advanced workflows like image editing and audio and video production.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, I found the screen on the Chromebook just a wee bit too small and the processor just a wee bit too slow to render web pages and web apps like Office 365 Online (needed for my work), so I started exploring modern Linux distributions.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e366h7nm0">Like coming home – only more modern</h2>
<p>Linux is not new to me. I started running Linux under <a href="http://www.slackware.com/announce/1.0.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Slackware 1.0</a> and had to build a custom PC just to use it, since so few components were supported in the early 90’s. A lot has changed since then.</p>
<p>I decided to experiment with Linux on a more powerful <a href="https://amzn.to/2LvmZ4y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">2-in-1 Dell Inspiron 7000</a> device. It’s a great design with a beautiful high resolution Gorilla Glass screen, aluminium body, i7 processor, 16 GB RAM and a lot more storage.</p>
<p>My first few attempts at installation (<a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Linux Mint</a>) were challenging. This PC is designed to run Windows 10 and there were some BIOS configuration changes I had to figure out in order to convince the machine that it could install Linux instead of Windows.</p>
<p>After a lot of Googling and even more trial and error, I finally got Linux Mint installed. It’s a vastly better experience than Windows and much more powerful than an off-the-shelf Chromebook. When it comes down to it, I use it for the same tasks as the Chromebook, except I’m not limited to Chrome OS and browser apps – I can run software applications natively in the OS.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself giving up my Mac for a Linux machine for tasks like video editing, podcasting or image editing, but I don’t do those things very often any more. But, with a Linux installation, I have the option to occasionally perform those tasks whereas those options were limited in Chrome OS.</p>
<p>After a few weeks, I felt that Linux Mint was <em>too much</em> like Windows and just didn’t feel like the Chromebook or Mac OS experiences I prefer, so I started looking at other desktop environments.</p>
<p>After exploring vanilla Ubuntu, Elementary OS and Plasma 5, I finally settled on <a href="https://pop.system76.com/docs/difference-between-pop-ubuntu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Pop!_OS from System76</a>.</p>
<p>The experience is wonderful – it’s well designed, roomy and feels much more like the elegant experience I’m used to on the Mac. The GNOME-based desktop environment is simple and uncluttered and the speed at which apps perform and web pages load is even faster than my MacBook Pro. (I guess that’s obvious given that the Mac has specs from 2015, but still.)</p>
<p>System maintenance is even more like a Mac. For instance, like Mac OS and Windows 10, the OS lets me know when there are software updates available and prompts me to upgrade. All I have to do is enter my credentials and the OS takes care of everything for me. In the “good old days,” of using Linux, I had to monitor the web and Usenet for software updates, then download and compile them from source code.</p>
<p>Those days are gone.</p>
<p>There’s also an “app store” called Pop!_Shop where you can find a curated catalog of commonly used Linux software. Again, all updates are managed by the OS, just like Mac OS or Windows 10.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338">
<figcaption >Pop! Shop</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e366h7nm1">Why not just get a new Mac or a faster Chromebook?</h2>
<p>A new Mac is overkill for my personal computing needs. I love my MacBook Pro and would be happy to be able to use it as my daily driver again, but I don’t see that happening any time soon.</p>
<p>A faster Chromebook would serve my usual needs, but why spend just about as much on a high-performance Chromebook to only have the limited functionality of Chrome OS? (Comparison: <a href="https://amzn.to/38dSQR2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Google Pixel</a> vs. <a href="https://amzn.to/2s3JTJt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Dell Inspiron 7000</a>)</p>
<p>A Linux laptop running Pop!_OS fits squarely in between an under-powered, education-oriented Chromebook and a new MacBook at a much more competitive price. I get high-performance access to my cloud services but can also occasionally run <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Gimp</a> for image editing or <a href="https://www.openshot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">OpenShot</a> for a quick video edit.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint has been battery life. Again, the battery performance claims for this machine are based on Windows 10 with drivers designed specifically for this hardware. It took me a bit of Googling to learn about modern Linux battery management before I could get the machine to run longer than a couple of hours on a charge. In addition to the Pop!_OS battery management tools (which are pretty good), I eventually installed <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/tlp-increase-and-optimize-linux-battery-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">TLP</a> and <a href="https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/09/tlpui-is-graphical-user-interface-for.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">TLPGUI</a> for more advanced battery management. After a few weeks of use with this setup, I’ve found battery life to be more than acceptable.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/5/tlpgui.png" alt="" width="1024" height="772">
<figcaption >TLP GUI</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e366h7nm2">Is this setup right for you?</h2>
<p>If you’re like me and most of your personal computing is cloud-based (or could be), I think you’d be surprised how much of your needs can be met by a set up like this.</p>
<p>Sure, you might not want to go through the hassle of tweaking the BIOS settings to get Linux to install, but really, once that’s done, installation is just like Mac OS or Windows 10. (<a href="https://system76.com/laptops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">You could also buy a machine preloaded with Pop!_OS from System76</a> but that option is not as attractive – both in cost and design – as a PC from a major OEM.)</p>
<p>If you prefer Mac OS-style computing, you can install a desktop environment that looks and behaves almost exactly like the Mac. Ditto for Windows. You can run your favorite browser (<a href="https://itsfoss.com/microsoft-edge-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">even if your favorite browser is Microsoft Edge</a>) to work with G Suite, Office 365 Online – even Apple iCloud.</p>
<p>That’s because <strong>using</strong> Pop!_OS is easy. If I set up a PC for my wife running Pop!_OS, she could complete her usual tasks with almost no learning curve. But she’s definitely not the sort of person to figure out how to get the PC to accept the installation. It’s not her thing.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a cottage industry in setting up user-friendly Linux installations on a device that a customer already owns? Probably not enough mass appeal there, but it’s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>If you want a quick run through of Pop!_OS you can watch the short video below. There are plenty of others on YouTube but they’re mostly reviews by Linux geeks, for Linux geeks.</p>

                <p>I’m very fortunate. I work for a company that closes down for the holidays, from December 25th to January 2nd.</p>
<p>For me, this is a period of decompression. Not just because <strong><em>I</em></strong> have the time off from work, but because <strong><em>all of my colleagues</em></strong> do, as well. There’s no pressure to check email every day and, should anything urgent pop-up during that period, people can always text me.</p>
<p>But mostly, in addition to spending time with family and friends, I take this time to learn new things and to tinker – activities I rarely have time to do throughout the year.</p>
<p>Here’s this year’s list.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="installed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gadgetboy.org/2020/01/05/alarming-news/" target="_blank">installed</a> a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ring Alarm System (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2ZSQjYJ" target="_blank">Ring Alarm System</a> </strong>that included the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ring Alarm Retrofit Kit (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/35oIjjw" target="_blank">Ring Alarm Retrofit Kit</a> and the existing home security wiring. I learned a lot about home security wiring and, more importantly, how the home security market is being disrupted by the Internet of Things (IoT).</li>
<li>I kicked my <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Vera Edge (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2Qo1c1F" target="_blank">Vera Edge</a> home controller to the curb and <strong>built a new home automation system from scratch</strong> using the open source <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Home Assistant (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> software, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Raspberry Pi 4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2QL4riJ" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 4</a> and a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="GoControl HUSBZB-1 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2SUbeJv" target="_blank">GoControl HUSBZB-1</a>. (Full post to come.)</li>
<li><strong>I started learning <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="YAML (opens in a new tab)" href="https://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a>.</strong> Even though you don’t have to break out a programmers text editor to use Home Assistant, if you want to create more complex automations or get very specific in how you configure the user interface, you have to use YAML. This also helped me in my next endeavor.</li>
<li><strong>I learned how to manage <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ruby (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a> packages</strong> so that I could <strong>install and configure <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Jekyll (opens in a new tab)" href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> </strong>to publish this blog. (Full post to come) Jekyll helps you build static sites so they are <em>really</em> fast and, most importantly, <strong>unhackable</strong>. I’ve had way too many WordPress instances get hacked and fixing them was a major PITA. Jekyll is also configured using YAML. <br><br>Do I really need to do this? I mean, a basic blog on WordPress.com is cheap, fast and reliable. <br><br>Of course not. I just want to learn something new. <br><br>Once I figure out how to customize Jekyll themes and import posts from WordPress, I’ll probably host the files on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="GitHub Pages (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. I’ve been considering running the static site from a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Raspberry Pi 2 B (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2ZSV9Fn" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 2 B</a> on my home network, but this might be more trouble than it’s worth. I ran out of time during this holiday break, so getting this working will take a little longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>What did you learn this year?</p>

                    <img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/4/sirens.png" alt="Sirens" />
                <p>Before moving our family to Austin, we lived in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maplewood,+NJ+07040/@40.7298131,-74.2836195,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c3ac591c878dfb:0x71f900089a81168b!8m2!3d40.7312956!4d-74.2707509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Maplewood, NJ (opens in a new tab)">Maplewood, NJ</a> where we owned a 110-year old home. It’s a beautiful house with original mahogany mouldings, unique pine flooring and a gorgeous wrap-around porch.</p>
<p>But, it also had a basement that was full of water after Hurricane Sandy, a kitchen from the 80’s (until we renovated before selling), knob-and-tube wiring and plaster walls.</p>
<p>Modernizing it was a money-losing battle.</p>
<p>Knowing that, you can probably understand why we were ecstatic when we moved into our new home in Austin.</p>
<p>Because it was new.</p>
<p>Just built.</p>
<p>Never lived in.</p>
<p>By anyone.</p>
<p>And it has a modern, open concept layout with modern construction and amenities. Things like energy efficient windows, central air conditioning, a sprinkler system for the lawn and a home security system.</p>
<p>When we lived in Maplewood, I tried an after-market home security system almost 15 years ago. It never worked properly and installation required sticking chunky white pieces of plastic on every door and window. I cancelled the service and tossed it all.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, it was nice to have the house pre-wired with hidden (or barely visible) alarm contacts everywhere. Better still, if we have it professionally monitored, we receive a discount on our homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>Something about it bugged me, though.</p>
<p>I mean, WE LIVE IN THE FUTURE, where everything is “smart” and networked, yet the home security system they installed in our house is the same technology that’s been in use <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="since it was invented in 1853 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://homesecurity.net/history/" target="_blank"><strong>since it was invented in 1853</strong></a>. Seriously – you can buy <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dsc.com/alarm-security-products/PC1616%20-%20PowerSeries%20Control%20Panel%20PC1616/1" target="_blank">one of these units</a> on eBay for $60.</p>
<p>It can only be programmed and managed through its <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="archaic keypad (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dsc.com/index.php?n=Products&amp;o=view&amp;id=1278" target="_blank">archaic keypad</a>. There are no DIY instructions. (So that they can protect their installer network.) It has no remote access controls and has to be wired for monitoring via a 2G cellular modem since we don’t have old school telephone service, only internet over fiber.</p>
<p>So when Amazon presented its 2019 product showcase, as far as I’m concerned, the most interesting thing they announced wasn’t the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Amazon Smart Oven (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2PEku1c" target="_blank">Amazon Smart Oven</a> or the new <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Echo Buds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2YFJXvk" target="_blank">Echo Buds</a>.</p>
<p>It was the <a href="https://amzn.to/35j2rUG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit</a>.</p>
<p>This magical device lets you connect your existing wired home security system to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2PgrXED" target="_blank">Ring Alarm Base Station</a>*. From there, you can get professional monitoring  over the internet – with LTE cellular backup – and control the entire system via the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ring mobile app (opens in a new tab)" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ring-always-home/id926252661" target="_blank">Ring mobile app</a>, including arming, disarming, guest access and panic mode.</p>

<figcaption >Ring Alarm Mobile App</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also add wireless accessories like <a href="https://amzn.to/34lNr7x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="motion sensors (opens in a new tab)">motion sensors</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/36EA0B7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="keypads (opens in a new tab)">keypads</a>.</p>
<p>Every component is either battery powered or has battery backup. If, for whatever reason, a thief decides that our home is an attractive target and figures out how to cut the power, the entire system still functions. If said thief decides to cut the internet connection, the system will still send triggers over LTE. (Backup and redundancy are your friends.)</p>
<p>I installed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amzn.to/2PgrXED" target="_blank">Ring Alarm Base Station</a> before the Retrofit Alarm Kit arrived, which was simple.</p>

<figcaption >Ring Alarm Base Station</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I hid the base station (which also acts as the primary siren) behind some picture frames on the entertainment center in the living room and added a second <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="wireless keypad (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/36EA0B7" target="_blank">wireless keypad</a> by the backdoor so that I don’t have to run to the front of the house to disarm the system when my 14-year-old Cocker Spaniel needs to go outside in the middle of the night. (She’s a senior dog. I have to move quickly to get her out or things can get messy.)</p>

</figure>
<p>Next, I added a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://shop.ring.com/collections/accessories/products/dome-siren" target="_blank">Dome Siren</a> to ensure that anyone on the second floor can also hear the alarm and a second <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2E9wBhk" target="_blank">motion sensor</a> to cover the front and garage doors.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e34v4h1n0">Truly Alarming</h2>
<p>While I’m pretty comfortable with most tech, I had a momentary loss of confidence when reading the product page for the Retrofit Kit on Ring.com and opted for professional installation via <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ontechsmartservices.com/" target="_blank">OnTech</a>.</p>
<p>That was a huge mistake.</p>
<p>After showing up an hour later than than the allotted window, the installer – a nice, young man in his early 20’s – had <strong>no idea</strong> what he was doing. He’d never installed one of these before and had <strong>only watched a YouTube video</strong>. I immediately lost confidence.</p>
<p>And, boy, was I right.</p>
<p>Step number one in any job like this: label all your wires before you pull everything apart. Even though there were supposed to be six zones, he labelled only three wires – and they were all labelled incorrectly. In fact, he installed the <strong>AC power</strong> and <strong>siren</strong> connections as zones. (Thankfully, I had already disconnected the power or he would have fried the unit.)</p>
<p>I had to remove the old alarm system while he was <strong>reading the documentation on his phone</strong> and talking to his manager because he thought he was going to install a <strong>wireless</strong> system in the existing steel box. <strong>Nothing</strong> about the Retrofit Kit worked when he left. His “manager was going to call me to reschedule” but that never happened.</p>
<p>I contacted them for a refund and they were supposed to get back to me “in the morning.” That also never happened. I finally disputed the charge with my credit card issuer.</p>
<p>The next day, I ended up pulling apart his mess and installing the system myself. It took me about an hour. But what I discovered during the installation process <strong>really</strong> pissed me off.</p>
<p>When we bought the house, the alarm was pre-installed during construction. (The best time to do it, natch.) The installers wired everything to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="DSC PC1616 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dsc.com/index.php?n=products&amp;o=view&amp;id=1" target="_blank">DSC PC1616</a> – a six zone alarm system. However, there are <strong>20</strong> wired zones. They spliced numerous zones into single zone ports on the alarm system and just labelled them “Garage-Office-Dining Room-Back Door.”</p>
<p>It was a total clusterf*ck.</p>
<p>First, because it was a <strong>hack</strong> and second, because the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit runs on Lithium batteries – and there isn’t nearly enough power to activate and monitor multiple zones on a single circuit.</p>
<p>Since each Retrofit Alarm Kit only has eight zones, I ended up having to buy a second unit so that I could properly wire each zone. For those of you doing the math at home, yes, there will be a few zones that aren’t wired, but all of them require a thirty-foot ladder to get near them, so I feel comfortable leaving them that way, for now. I may grab a third unit when they go on sale in the future, just to make sure all zones are wired.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e34v4h1n1">Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>My final configuration will be to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028205592-Using-Alexa-Guard-with-Alarm-to-Detect-Broken-Glass-Smoke-and-Carbon-Monoxide" target="_blank">set up our Echo devices with Alexa Guard to act as glass break, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors</a>. (We own five Echo Dots and a Sonos Play One, though only the Echo devices support this feature.) This is a huge bonus – I don’t have to buy any additional hardware** to let the monitoring station know which sensor is triggered. If no one responds to the safety check, they’ll simply send the appropriate emergency service to the house.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the whole set up is the remote access. We can now arm and disarm every sensor in the system from our smartphones wherever we are and also grant access to friends and family by giving them a temporary passcode. The convenience is great.</p>
<p>The icing on the proverbial cake?</p>
<p>The professional monitoring from Ring is half the cost of monitoring from my existing service provider – and I didn’t have to pay extra for the cellular hardware. The purchase of the Ring products will almost pay for themselves in the <s>first</s> second year and the system includes all the convenience we’ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>I’ll unload the old system on eBay or Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator">
<p>*Only 8 zones are supported.</p>
<p>**If you don’t have an Echo device, you can purchase <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/35l5LyL" target="_blank">a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms</a> and send the appropriate trigger to the monitoring station.</p>

                <p>Two months ago, I took the plunge and <a href="https://gadgetboy.org/2019/10/27/going-keto/">changed to a Ketogenic diet</a>. Here are my observations, so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find a Keto meal in most places – but not everywhere. Be sure to check the menu before you decide to eat out. My wife and I went to a really great place for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and there’s was barely anything that I could make work with my diet.</li>
<li>You have to keep things interesting. Sure, it’s great to have some go-to meals to prepare but you have to keep exploring new recipes or you will get bored.</li>
<li>Avocados are your friend.</li>
<li>I haven’t lost any weight, but I have lost inches. I had to buy new, smaller jeans and many of my favorite shirts now fit again. I’ve started intermittent fasting to see if that will help kick start things.</li>
<li>My endurance during CrossFit has been much improved. I’m able to complete most workouts without having to stop to catch my breath or deal with the usual stitch in my side (caused by irregular, intense breathing.).</li>

                <p>I have a history with vacuums.</p>
<p>When I was 11 years old, I disassembled the vacuum to see how the parts worked, then rushed to put it back together before my Mom got home. (It still worked.) From that experience, my brother nicknamed me Gadgetboy, so this post is quite fitting.</p>
<p>When my wife and I moved our family to Austin, we ended up buying a ginormous house, partly because my wife and I both needed home offices, partly because we like this community and couldn’t wait for a more suitably sized house to be built, since we had to enroll our son for the new school year.</p>
<p>We haven’t regretted our purchase, except for the one thing we didn’t consider: cleaning it.</p>
<p>Cleaning a house of this size is an all-day affair for two adults. We finally admitted defeat and hired someone to do it a couple of times a month, but that’s still not enough – especially when there are two teenagers, two adults and two dogs living here. The dark wood floors ultimately get covered in tumble weeds of dog hair mixed with crumbs from dog treats.</p>
<p>My wife and I both work crazy hours and the last thing we want to do is have to clean again in between cleaning service, so I began exploring robot vacuums.</p>
<p>For years, the only good robot vacuum was a Roomba. It was crazy expensive and never quite as good as a traditional vacuum, but a lot has changed in the past few years. You can find a decent robot vacuum for around $200 these days which will work fine for a small house or apartment.</p>
<p>But our needs are a little different. We needed something that could clean our ground floor relatively quickly and consistently. But before I share my experience, let me give you a quick rundown of considerations when buying one of these suckers.</p>
<p>What’s important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suction power</li>
<li>Battery life</li>
<li>Bin size</li>
<li>Ability to work on hard floors and carpet</li>
<li>Warranty</li>
<li>Repairability</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s about it.</p>
<p>(If you really want to geek out when shopping for a robot vacuum, visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvavJlMjlTd4wLwi9yKCtew">Vacuum Wars YouTube channel</a>. Yes, that’s a thing.)</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there is one critical and sometimes overlooked feature of a robot vacuum, especially for larger homes.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e368b3950">Navigation</h2>
<p>There are basically two types of navigation: the random, bumping-around-the-house-until-it’s-clean type, and the more intelligent, S-patterned type.</p>
<p>Inexpensive robot vacuums will basically just bounce off of objects around your home until its onboard software determines that it has covered the area it’s supposed to clean. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but in larger homes, it can take a long time, especially since it will vacuum over spots it has already cleaned until it has completely covered the floor. This approach also makes it more likely that the robot needs to return to the dock to recharge during a session, extending the completion time even further.</p>
<p>Also, as part of any navigation, you’ll want to be able to block the vacuum from going to certain places like, say, your kids playroom or keeping the vacuum from falling down stairs. Inexpensive vacuums can do this but they usually require the placement of some sort of signalling tape that you place around your home. It’s not the most attractive option.</p>
<p>If you want to clean larger spaces more quickly, you need more advanced navigation. That’s where the S-patterned approach comes in.</p>
<p>The first time this type of vacuum goes about its business, it will behave more-or-less like the navigation described above. After that, it has captured a map of your home in its onboard software and that’s where things get interesting – and faster.</p>
<p>Once the robot knows the basic layout of your home, it will begin to vacuum floors in a regular back-and-forth motion (sometimes referred to as an S-pattern) until it has reached the end of the room, then it will switch to another room and repeat the process until all of your designated floors are clean.</p>
<p>After researching robot vacuums (and watching <em>way</em> too many Vacuum Wars videos) I decided that this type of navigation was the best option for us.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI">Roborock S5 </a>went on sale (and I had a bunch of Amazon affiliate earnings banked) I made the purchase.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e368b3951">Meet Rosie</h2>

<figcaption >RoboRock S5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Setting up the <a href="https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI">Roborock S5</a> was easy as pie. I unboxed it, plugged in the charger and placed it in its new home. While it was charging, I set up the mobile app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mi-home-xiaomi-smarthome/id957323480">Mi Home</a>) on my iPhone and connected the robot to my Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>As part of the process, I had the option to name it.</p>
<p>I named it Rosie.</p>
<p>For those of my generation, you’ll remember Rosie, the robot house keeper from The Jetsons. It’s a perfect, geeky, nostalgic name choice.</p>
<p>When it was fully charged, I gave it a go.</p>
<p>During its first run, it had a difficult time getting itself up onto the high-pile area rug in the living room and a few times, I realized that I forgot to put away the dog toys or slippers, so I had to run around the house to pick those up. Other than that, it did a nice job of cleaning the floors.</p>
<p>The second time I ran it, I got the following results.<img class="post__image" src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/img-2004.jpg" alt="Floor Map" width="650" height="1023"></p>
<p>The yellow dot is Rosie’s home, in the dining room, next to the sideboard.</p>
<p>Notice the S-pattern throughout the house in almost every room. But here’s what becomes more interesting: if you know the layout of the house, you know exactly why the map looks like it does.<img class="post__image" src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/img-2005.jpg" alt="Annotated Floor Map" width="650" height="1025"></p>
<p>With that discovery, I have to say that I had a minor freakout.</p>
<p>What does Xiaomi (the manufacturer) do with this data? Is it shared with anyone? Do employees have access to it? Does it know my location?</p>
<p>I decided to find out.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e368b3952"><a href="https://cnbj1.fds.api.xiaomi.com/html/en/mihome_use_agreement.html">Terms of Service</a></h2>
<p>It’s pretty much what you’d expect, except for a few concerning items.</p>
<p><code>5.5. Xiaomi specifically brings to the User's attention that, 
in order to protect the company's business development and right to make
 adjustments, Xiaomi has the right to modify or suspend the services at 
any time without notice to the User and without any liability to the 
User or any third party.</code></p>
<p>This means that if Xiaomi ever decides to end the service, I’m SOL. Rosie becomes a door stop.</p>
<p><code>VII. Amendment</code></p>
<p><code>7.1. Xiaomi has the right to amend the terms of this Agreement 
when necessary, and any such amended terms will be published on relevant
 web pages. If the User does not agree with the amended terms, the User 
shall cancel the service. The User's continuing to use the service 
constitutes acceptance of the amended terms of the Agreement.</code></p>
<p>Xiaomi reserves the right to amend the user agreement at any time. It’s up to me to monitor this agreement for amendments.</p>
<p><code>7.2. Xiaomi and the Partner have the right to modify or change 
the paid services provided, the charging criteria, charging method, 
service charges and service terms according to their needs. When 
providing services, Xiaomi may start to charge some users certain fees 
either now or in the future. If the User refuses to pay such fees, the 
User will be unable to continue using relevant services after the new 
charge begins. Xiaomi and its Partner will do their utmost to notify the
 User of any amendments or changes by email or other means.</code></p>
<p>Things that were once free may become premium (paid) services. If I prefer not to pay these fees, Rosie becomes a door stop.</p>
<p><code>VIII. Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution</code></p>
<p><code>8.1. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be
 governed by the laws of the Mainland of the People's Republic of China.
 In the absence of relevant legal provisions, international business 
practices and/or business practices may be used as references.</code></p>
<p>Do I feel like Xiaomi has breached this agreement or is at fault for something? I’ll have to visit Mainland China and file a suit in their court system.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e368b3953"><a href="https://cnbj1.fds.api.xiaomi.com/html/en/mihome_privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a></h2>
<p><code>What information is collected, and how we use it</code></p>
<p><code>Types of information collected</code></p>
<p><code>Information related to the handheld device terminal or your SIM
 card: we may collect information related to the operation of the Mi 
Home handheld device terminal. For example, IMEI number, IMSI number, 
the version of your operating system, manufacturing information about 
your device, model name, and network operator. We may also collect 
information about the device associated with your account. For example, 
MAC address, DID, network  status of the device (IP/network signal), and
 the version of your firmware.</code></p>
<p>Xiaomi collects just about everything that it can about my smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p><code>Information we designate that is about you: We may collect and use content such as information related to your Xiaomi account.</code></p>

functionalities): various types of information on your location. For 
example, region, country code, city code, mobile network code, mobile 
country code, cell identity, district name, longitude and latitude 
information, time zone settings, language settings.</code></p>
<p>…and collects just about everything related to my location.</p>
<p><code>Other information: environmental characteristics value (ECV) 
(i.e. value generated from Xiaomi Account ID, phone device ID, connected
 Wi-Fi ID and location value).</code></p>
<p>And some sort of algorithmic identifier based on all of the above.</p>
<p><code>How this personal information can be used</code></p>
<p><code>Direct marketing</code></p>
<p><code>We may use your name, phone number, email address, Xiaomi or Mi
 Home account number, or IMEI number to provide you relating to goods 
and services of Xiaomi companies and our business partners which offer 
network, mobile applications and cloud products and services. We will 
only so use your personal data after we obtain your prior explicit 
consent and involve a clear affirmative action we have obtained your 
consent or indication of no objection in accordance with local data 
protection laws, which may require separate explicit consent. You have 
the right to opt out of our proposed use of your personal data for 
direct marketing. If you no longer wish to receive certain types of 
email communications you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link 
located at the bottom of each communication. We will not transfer your 
personal data to our business partners for use by our business partners 
in direct marketing.</code></p>
<p>They may deliver marketing messages, either directly from Xiaomi or “Business Partners.” It’s not clear if they share personal information with these partners to deliver the message or if the messages are sent through Xiaomi’s services.</p>
<p>Here’s the important stuff.</p>
<p><code>With whom we share your information?</code></p>
<p><code>We do not sell any personal information to third parties.</code></p>
<p>So far, so good…</p>
<p><code>We may disclose your personal information to third parties (as 
defined below) in order to provide products or services that you have 
requested.</code></p>
<p><code>We may disclose information to the third-party service 
providers and affiliates listed at the end of the section. In any of the
 various situations described at the end of the section, you can rest 
assured that Xiaomi will only share the personal information in 
accordance with your consent. Your consent to Xiaomi will engage 
sub-processors for the processing of your personal information. Please 
understand that if, in any of the situations described below, Xiaomi 
shares your information with a third-party service provider, Xiaomi will
 contractually specify that the third party is subject to practices and 
obligations to comply with applicable local data protection laws. Xiaomi
 will contractually ensure compliance by any Third Party Service 
Providers with the privacy standards that apply to them in your home 
jurisdiction.</code></p>
<p>It looks like they won’t share personal information without explicit consent and will obligate compliance of any third-parties with whom they share the information.</p>
<p><code>Sharing with our group and third-party service provider</code></p>
<p><code>In order to operate successfully and provide you with the full 
functionality of our products and services, We may disclose your 
personal information to other Xiaomi affiliated companies (these may 
include communications, social media, technology, or cloud services) or 
our third-party service providers (our mailing centers, delivery 
services providers, telecommunications companies, data centers, data 
storage facilities, customer service providers, advertising and 
promotional service providers, and agents representing Xiaomi) 
[affiliated companies and/or other third parties] (collectively referred
 to as "third-party service providers"). Such third-party service 
providers may process your personal information on Xiaomi's behalf or 
for one or more of the purposes listed above. When using certain mobile 
applications on our devices, we may share your IP address with third 
parties in order to provide you with some of the services you requested.
 If you would no longer wish to allow us to share this information, 
please contact us by sending an email to privacy@xiaomi.com.</code></p>
<p>As per GDPR and CCPA requirements they call out the use of sub-processors.</p>
<p><code>Sharing information with our group's ecosystem companies</code></p>
<p><code>Xiaomi works with a group of very forward-thinking companies. 
Together, they form the Xiaomi Ecosystem. Xiaomi Ecosystem companies are
 independent entities, invested and incubated by Xiaomi, and they are 
experts in their fields. Xiaomi may disclose your personal information 
to Xiaomi Ecosystem companies in order to provide you with and make 
improvements to a range of exciting products and services (including 
software and hardware). Some of these products and services will be 
under the Xiaomi, Mi, Mi Home brand, while other products may use their 
own brand. Xiaomi Ecosystem companies may share data with Xiaomi related
 to Xiaomi, Mi, Mi Home brand products and services in order to provide 
software and hardware services, create better functionality, and provide
 a better user experience. Xiaomi will take appropriate organizational 
and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data during 
the process of sharing of information, including but not limited to 
encryption of your personal data. If Xiaomi is involved in the merger, 
acquisition, or sale of all or part of its assets, we will notify you of
 any change to the ownership of, use of, or any of the choices you have 
regarding your personal information by email and/or by posting a notice 
on our website.</code></p>
<p>…but they may share my personal information with “Xiaomi Ecosystem Companies.” Regardless of ownership structure, these are companies with whom I have not given explicit permission to receive and use my personal information.</p>
<p><code>Sharing of information with others</code></p>
<p><code>Xiaomi may disclose your personal information to others without further consent when required under applicable law.</code></p>
<p><code>Information not requiring consent</code></p>
<p><code>We may share anonymized information in aggregate form with 
third parties (such as advertisers on our website) for commercial 
purposes. We may share trends in common usage of our services, for 
example, the number of customers in a particular group who purchase 
certain products or engage in certain transactions.</code></p>
<p><code>For the avoidance of doubt, Xiaomi may collect, use, or 
disclose your personal information without your consent if it is and 
only to the extent it is allowed explicitly under local data protection 
laws (to, for example, comply with a subpoena). We may also disclose 
your information without your consent if we believe in good faith that 
it must be disclosed in order to protect our rights, your safety, or the
 safety of others; investigate fraud; or respond to government requests.</code></p>
<p>If law enforcement wants to know if my robot vacuum committed a crime, I’m fine with it.</p>
<p><code>Retention policy</code></p>
<p><code>We retain information we collect about you as long as it is 
still needed for the purposes we obtained it or as long as it is needed 
to comply with applicable legal requirements or permissions. We shall 
cease to retain personal information, or remove the means by which the 
personal information can be associated with particular individuals, as 
soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which that 
personal information was collected is no longer being served by 
retention of the personal information. If further processing is for 
archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical 
research purposes or statistical purposes according to the applicable 
laws, the data can be further retained by Xiaomi even if the further 
processing is incompatible with original purposes.</code></p>
<p>Basically, Xiaomi reserves the right to keep personal information on file in perpetuity.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e368b3954">Summary</h2>
<p>In the final analysis, I’m happy with the Roborock S5 during the short time that I’ve owned it, but I’m not terribly excited by the ambiguity of the personal information protections.</p>
<p>A device of this type is wonderfully convenient, but it opens up a huge can of proverbial worms. We’re no longer just concerned about simple data like name, email address and telephone number – we’re now concerned with the entire layout of a home, its size and contents.</p>
<p>I’ll let you know if the cops show up at my door to question Rosie.</p>

                <p>When my youngest brother started going to school all day, my Mom went back to work and I became a latchkey kid.</p>
<p>I would get home every day around 3 in the afternoon, usually to find instructions from my Mom on how to get dinner started. One day, she asked me to marinade some meat with this recipe and I’ve been using it ever since. It’s become a staple in my cooking.</p>
<p>Before starting Keto I generally didn’t measure much in my cooking (except for baking) but now that I’m watching my macros, I figured it was time to write this down.</p>
<p>I use it on everything – beef, chicken, shrimp, scallops – but my favorite use of this marinade is on pork loin. After marinading it in a ziplock bag, I’ll usually put the whole thing into a <a href="https://amzn.to/32xnSiB">sous vide water bath</a> and cook it slowly for about 90 minutes at 129 degrees Fahrenheit. When it’s done, I just throw it on a hot grill for 2 minutes on each side to sear it.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e368ng620">Mom’s Honey Garlic Keto Marinade</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup of olive oil</li>
<li>1/2 cup of soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of <a href="https://amzn.to/2Q0lVZI">agave nectar</a> or honey</li>

                    <img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/5ca20fab-6058-4564-9750-35ca23620ea7.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>What do you do when you’re “Directionally Challenged” and need GPS to get around on your motorcycle?</p>
<p>This is something I’ve been wrestling with for 5+ years.</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult, really. Moto GPS units have been around for decades and there are plenty of smartphone mounts to choose from if you prefer to use Google Maps or one of its ilk.</p>
<p>I’m very particular about my bike and what sort of bits and bobs I put on it. But it’s a lot more than that.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm40">Things to consider</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm41">Smartphone or dedicated GPS unit?</h3>
<p>This is an easy decision. The smartphone in your pocket is better than just about any moto GPS unit you can buy today and it’s always up-to-date. Moto GPS units from companies like Garmin sometimes require that you hook it up to a computer to upgrade the maps and sometimes for a fee.</p>
<p>If you’re just riding around town or on a day trip with your friends, why bother with that? I use my iPhone.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm42">Style</h3>
<p>I love my bike and don’t want anything to interfere with its aesthetics. I ride what is referred to as a Modern Classic – a bike that resembles (or sometimes looks exactly like) its original versions from the early 20th century – but with modern upgrades to fuel intake, brakes, catalytic converters, etc.</p>
<p>I tend to like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_racer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Café Racer (opens in a new tab)">Café Racer</a> styling, made popular in 1960’s England, which is simple, clean and reduced to its barest necessities. With that in mind, hanging stuff on the bike is anathema to that. Trust me – <a href="https://gadgetboy.org/2017/02/01/2017-1-29-heritage-motorcycle-luggage-project/">choosing luggage for my previous bike was an agonizing process</a>, especially since I refused to spend what is typically hundreds of dollars for a moto side bag.</p>
<p>Style has been a huge factor in my decision making process, especially when I’ve seen riders attach <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="these monstrosities (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2PRl9jl" target="_blank">these monstrosities</a> to their bikes. When deciding on a mount, I want something small and unobtrusive that blends with the style and color of the bike, not something that looks like an odd appendage.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm43">Security</h3>
<p>Even though style is important to me, this is really <strong>the</strong> most important thing to consider. You don’t want a $1,000 smartphone flying off your bike at 75 mph. There are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="countless mounts available (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2UrGtu7" target="_blank">countless mounts available</a> and just as many horror stories (and videos!) of riders losing their smartphones because of them.</p>
<p>Sure, my iPhone is insured, (you were expecting otherwise? 😉 ) but I just don’t need the complication of replacing a phone. I want something that’s going to work reliably.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm44">Voice Navigation</h3>
<p>I need turn-by-turn voice navigation. Getting around any city, especially Austin, Texas, can be a dangerous proposition and you don’t want to take your eyes off the road to look for your next turn. For longer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Hill Country (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Hill_Country" target="_blank">Hill Country</a> rides, it’s fine to quickly look at a screen to see how far you are from your next turn, but not in the city.</p>
<p>For years, I’ve been wearing <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ultimate Ears barrel-style (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2NIuAi2" target="_blank">Ultimate Ears barrel-style</a> headphones under my helmet connected to my iPhone in my jacket pocket for voice navigation. These type of headphones perform double duty as they also protect your hearing from wind and engine noise. Also important: the headphone wires are directed downward at all times – you don’t have to worry about wrapping anything around your ears and having the wires or headphones shift around under your helmet.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image" >
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img class="post__image align-center" src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/71yvit0zus._sl1500_.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="354"></figure>
</div>
<p>There a couple of downsides to this method. The biggest is that some mapping apps (Waze, for instance) don’t really behave well when operating with the screen turned off which, of course, you have to do since it’s in your pocket and leaving the screen on would trigger all sorts of unwanted commands. I’ve also found that the device will sometimes lose its GPS signal or simply think that I’ve paused my route, requiring that I pull over, take off my gloves, dig the phone out of the inside pocket and restart the route. Having a mount would reduce some of this inconvenience, especially if I bought a pair of touchscreen-friendly moto gloves.</p>
<p>If voice navigation is important, then the downside to using a mount is that you now need to consider how you get the sound from the phone on the handlebars to your ears. Dangling wires are a safety hazard and probably wouldn’t survive for long at high speeds.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm45">Bluetooth</h3>
<p>Bluetooth is, of course, the answer to the above problem but typical bluetooth headphones just don’t work. The best I found were the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="torc-style headphones from LG (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2NItmU9" target="_blank">torc-style headphones from LG</a> but the device controls (play/pause, skip, volume, etc.) would constantly get triggered under the collar of my jacket. Wearing them outside the jacket collar wasn’t an option as the torc would fly off.</p>
<p>After some searching, I found <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2LiGRZc" target="_blank">this adapter that adds bluetooth capabilities to wired headphones</a>. I’ve taken it for a few test rides and it works as advertised. Music doesn’t sound great but that’s not as big of a concern for me.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image" >
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img class="post__image" src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/61hu3f0cxl._sl1317_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="295"></figure>
</div>
<p>(TIP: If I didn’t already own the one mentioned above, I’d would get <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="this new one (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2MQ4JoT" target="_blank">this new version</a> with bluetooth 5.0 and expanded codec support.)</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm46">The Purchase (Finally)</h2>
<p>After lots of overthinking, I decided that I wanted a twist-lock-style mount. This type of mount requires either a dedicated case or adhering some sort of adapter to the back of your phone. The latter wasn’t an option (the iPhone XS has a glass back) so I surrendered to the case.</p>
<p>I looked at both the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.quadlockcase.com" target="_blank">QuadLock</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="SP Connect (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sp-connect.com/" target="_blank">SP Connect</a> systems and ultimately selected the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="SP Connect Moto Mount Pro with a bundled case for the iPhone (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sp-connect.com/collections/motorbike/products/moto-bundle?variant=52406874581" target="_blank">SP Connect Moto Mount Pro with a bundled case for the iPhone</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vborxjgx88k" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" ></iframe></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper" > </div>
</figure>
<p>The phone can be inserted or removed easily enough with a little fiddling, so I don’t have to use it as my day-to-day phone protection. The most important factor in my decision was the build quality of the mount: QuadLock uses plastic mounts while SP Connect uses aluminum with a vibration dampening system.</p>
<p>I’m sure plastic works fine for this application but the aluminum makes me feel like the phone is more secure. (And it looks nicer than plastic.)</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3692hm47">First Ride</h3>
<div class="gallery"   >
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1858-1.jpg" ><img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1858-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="768"></a></figure>
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1859.jpg" ><img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/10/gallery/img_1859-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="768"></a></figure>
</div>
<p>I put it on the bike a couple of days ago and went for a long ride in Hill Country with some friends.</p>
<p>Installation was easy and was completed in 5 minutes. I thought I would be able to extend the extension arm over the center of the handlebar mount but there wasn’t enough clearance. In the end, the final location was best anyway – slightly left of handlebar mount. I mounted it in landscape position and can still clearly see all the gauges while riding.</p>
<p>The twist-lock case connects to the mount quickly and solidly, then you’re ready to ride.</p>
<p>I used it in the morning to navigate to the meeting spot for our group ride. It was nice to have visual confirmation along with my voice navigation.</p>
<p>After lunch, we each went our separate ways, so I used the phone for directions home. The battery was nearly dead at the end of the 90 minute ride which I attribute to the screen being continuously turned on.</p>
<p>My options going forward would be to either leave the screen turned off (which sort of defeats the benefits of a mount) or route power to it. Luckily, my new bike has a USB port under the seat. I just have to figure out how to the best way to hide the cable.</p>
<p><em>I have no financial relationship with SP United USA and I purchased my own Moto Bundle. Some of the links above point to Amazon. If you buy something from those links, I’ll earn a few cents.</em></p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/11/tesla_road_trip_sante_fe.png" alt="" />
                <p>For our family vacation this Summer, we decided to explore Santa Fe, New Mexico. I thought it would be a fun road trip from Austin, Texas and decided to drive my Long Range Model 3.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd0">Routes</h2>
<p>First, I checked Google Maps to get an estimate of miles and duration. It estimated ~680 miles and 10.5 hours, without breaks.</p>
<p>Then I visited <a href="https://www.tesla.com/trips">Tesla.com/trips</a> to see if it was a feasible trip and Tesla indicated almost 760 miles and 13.5 hours, including 4 stops to Supercharge.</p>
<p>At that point, I was debating the use of the Tesla for this trip but someone recommended <a href="https://abetterrouteplanner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABetterRoutePlanner.com</a> (ABRP) so I tried it.</p>
<p>It really <strong>is</strong> a better route planner taking into account things like State of Charge (SoC) upon leaving, estimated state of charge on arrival, reference speed, max speed, additional weight (passengers + luggage), elevation, wind speed, wind direction, outdoor temperature, road conditions and types of chargers you’d like to use.</p>
<p>When you load ABRP in the Model 3’s browser, it even shows an option to <em>Send to Tesla Nav</em> – providing you’ve connected your Tesla account to your ABRP account.</p>
<p>It’s very comprehensive, but I would soon learn that it’s not perfect and can’t realistically take every variable into account.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd1">Departing</h2>
<p>ABRP recommended that we depart with 90% SoC but we left home with 100% SoC – and it’s a good thing we did. ABRP estimated that we’d arrive in Cisco, TX with 33% charge but even after departing with 100% SoC, we arrived with less than 10%. Given that this was my first real road trip in my Model 3, it created quite a bit of anxiety.</p>
<p>After that, I ignored ABRP’s recommended departure SoC and charged to 90% or 100% each time.</p>
<p>My best guess is that I/ABRP didn’t properly account for the weight of the luggage and the outside temperature – it was over 100 degrees each day and we were running the AC constantly. Even with window tint on the sides and rear, the heat from the sun through the windshield was significant. I’ll probably tint the front windshield in the future to help.</p>
<p>After compensating by “overcharging” for the rest of the trip, we made it to Santa Fe without issue.</p>
<p>When we arrived, I charged to 90% at the local Supercharger, then headed to our AirBnB. The homeowner had an outdoor outlet on the front porch, close to the driveway, so every night, I would plug-in using my Tesla Mobile Charger and charge to 90%. It was slow of course, but we didn’t do much driving when in Santa Fe so it worked out perfectly. Even better, I didn’t have to visit the Supercharger before we began the return trip home.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd2">Returning</h2>
<p>I chose a different route on the way home. On the way to Santa Fe, we spent 10+ hours traveling on the first day and around 5 on the second day.</p>
<p>I decided to break up the trip into two shorter days on the way home and selected a different route.</p>
<p>Again, this was a mistake.</p>
<p>ABRP indicated that we could travel from Amarillo, TX to Sweetwater, TX and arrive with a 14% SoC. Based on my earlier experience, I knew this wasn’t going to be accurate. I worked the problem and came up with a solution: we stopped for dinner at the Overton Hotel in Lubbock where they had four Tesla Destination Chargers.</p>
<p>We charged for almost 2.5 hours while we had a nice, leisurely dinner and added about 110 miles of range.</p>
<p>We arrived at our hotel (where the Supercharger was*) in Sweetwater with plenty of charge to spare.</p>
<p>Finally, after leaving Sweetwater for Austin, we had a similar scare. We were traveling at the speed limit (75 MPH in Texas) when we received a warning: “Reduce speed to below 75 MPH to arrive at destination.” This is Tesla’s polite way of saying, “Yo! You are going to have to call a flatbed truck to take you to the nearest Supercharger if you don’t conserve your battery.”</p>
<p>After dropping to 75 MPH, I received the same warning, indicating that I should travel below 60 MPH.</p>
<p>The car indicated that we would arrive with 9% SoC and as you would expect, I didn’t want to risk it. We ended up driving further South to the Supercharger in Junction, TX where we grabbed a snack and charged to 90% SoC before heading to Austin. It added about an hour to the trip but we were all more relaxed (and cool, since we could run the AC without concern) so it was worth it.</p>
<p>We arrived home with about 100 miles of estimated range.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd3">Final Thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd4">We need more Superchargers, Elon! 😉</h3>
<p>This is a common complaint, so I won’t belabor the point – especially when you consider that the <a href="https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/supercharger-cost-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated cost</a> to build out a Tesla Supercharger station is around $250,000.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd5">The fuel savings are significant.</h3>
<p>We estimate that we saved more than $200 compared to driving my wife’s 2016 Toyota Highlander on this trip – even with the slight premium we paid for Supercharging. (Charging at home is typically much less expensive.)</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd6">Enter complete data when planning your route.</h3>
<p>ABRP is a great tool, but if you don’t feed it good data, it can’t accurately – and safely – predict your route. In this instance, I didn’t properly account for actual travel speed, elevations and topography, external temperature (which affects AC usage), wind speed and direction (West Texas is windy as hell – that’s why there are wind farms everywhere), and luggage weight.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd7">A Standard Range Model 3 seems like it’s only good for local driving – for now.</h3>
<p>I have a Long Range Model 3 and I could barely make it between Superchargers on my route. A Standard Range Model 3 would never have made it. (We need more Superchargers, Elon!) Granted, your route and destination matters – we traveled through the wide expanse of West Texas to get to New Mexico – so it might be different for other destinations.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e36a7jvd8">I would do it again.</h3>
<p>It was fun but more importantly, I really can’t drive an ICE car anymore. I find it cumbersome. I will drive my Tesla everywhere, range permitting.</p>
<p>* Tesla must have cut a nice deal with Holiday Inn as most of the Superchargers we encountered were in Holiday Inn/Express parking lots. Learning what I did on this trip, I will always choose the hotel with the Supercharger, event if it costs a few dollars more. Score for Holiday Inn.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, you just need to make a big change in your life to accomplish a goal.</p>
<p>Since I moved to Austin four years ago, I’ve packed on quite a bit of weight. Some of it was due to stress, some of it was due to inactivity and some of it was due to medication. (My doctor prescribed medication that made me gain 20 pounds in less than a month. I never lost it.)</p>
<p>I’m not looking to do anything crazy like drop down to my college weight. I just want to be healthy and fit back into my favorite jeans, sweaters and t-shirts.</p>
<p>In January, I returned to CrossFit after more than a year away due to plantar fasciitis and surgery to fix my sinuses. I’ve been training consistently three days a week plus additional days at the gym. I’ve been consuming less that 2,200 calories per day – sometimes around 1,800 – and have seen zero results.</p>
<p>Actually, that’s not completely true – I’ve gotten stronger, faster, improved my endurance and lowered my resting heart rate. I just haven’t decreased my girth.</p>
<p>I finally decided that it might be time to change my diet.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago, I tried Atkins. It worked pretty well but was difficult and expensive to stay on it for long stretches of time and didn’t work well with my anxiety. Plus, I was doing it alone – my wife wasn’t into it.</p>
<p>Atkins is similar to a Ketogenic diet, though not quite as strict, so instead of Atkins, my wife and I decided to give Keto a try.</p>
<p>It’s been about a week of eating high fat, moderate protein and low carbs – sometimes less than 20 grams of carbs per day. The food is delicious and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Jr616e">the recipes</a> we started with are pretty easy to prepare.</p>
<p>I was sedentary all last week due to a cold and even so, I’ve noticed a difference already.</p>
<p>I think this might be the regimen that actually works for me. Time (and persistence) will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ll share some of my experiences here.</p>

                    <img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/12/22e1e-highway21_turbine_mesh_jacket_black_rollover.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>This is most definitely a budget jacket that I’m reluctant to say, I bought for its style. Riding in the heat of Austin, Texas requires a mesh jacket and compared to most others, the design is simple and classic with only the single leather vertical strip. Branding is minimal.</p>
<p>The initial description indicates “CE Protection” but I bought it knowing full well that it would require an armor upgrade. The red flags are right in the description:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Full bore mesh outer shell</em>” (WTF does that mean? Where’s the denier rating?)</li>
<li>“<em>Removable PE Armor</em>” (WTF is PE Armor? I could find nothing about armor that’s PE rated on the interwebs.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The jacket fits as expected – the size chart indicated that I needed a large and it fits well. There are side panel zippers if you need a little more room as well as Velcro tabs to tighten the waist, if you need a little less.</p>
<p>There’s no zipper to attach to your pants but there is a tab and button snap so you can connect it to a belt or belt loop.</p>
<p>Construction is decent. The seams appear tight. The zippers don’t move as smoothly as I’d like, but it’s nothing a little beeswax didn’t fix. The material around the collar could be a bit softer – a microfiber fleece would be nice – but, again, you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>My Hydraguard liner doesn’t zip in – during assembly, a thread crossed over the liner zipper making it impossible to install the liner without cutting the thread – resulting in a failure of the outer zipper.</p>
<p>I have to take it to a tailor to for them to fix, adding more to the cost of the jacket. (I would have returned the jacket for a new one, but it was months before I even realized it was flawed.)</p>
<p>I wish there was one more snap to tighten the sleeves so that there’s less free play but it’s nothing I can’t live with.</p>
<p>Now for the big upgrade: armor.</p>
<p>I think its flat out deceptive to call the junk they put in this jacket “armor”. It feels like something you could buy at a craft store and will provide little to no protection if you go down. Throw it out and replace it.</p>
<p>I spoke with a Revzilla Gear Geek who was very helpful and suggested that I buy D3O armor as it can be trimmed to fit the armor pockets if necessary.</p>
<p>Luckily, I didn’t need to do that: the ICON D3O shoulder armor, elbow armor, and Viper back protector fit just fine. (The downside is that it’s orange in color and can sometimes be seen through the jacket. Not a deal killer at all.)</p>
<p>But that upgraded armor added an additional $70 to the cost of the jacket.</p>
<p>Will the mesh hold up in a slide? Probably not as well as a bombproof Klim jacket, but it’ll be better than squidding.</p>
<p>In the end, this budget jacket will have cost me around $170 once I pay a professional to fix the zipper, all in the name of style.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?</p>
<p>Depends on your style.</p>
<p>I already own a hi-viz Fly Coolpro jacket. If I were to start this process over, I’d probably just purchase another one in a more neutral color.</p>
<p><strong>[UPDATE:]</strong> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Revzilla (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.revzilla.com/" target="_blank">Revzilla</a> recently updated their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="video breakdown (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs3gnRwlIOs" target="_blank">video breakdown</a> of this jacket, basically telling you everything I say here, right down to the jump up to the CoolPro. The only difference is that they believe it runs a size larger. YMMV.</p>
