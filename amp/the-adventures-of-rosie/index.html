(It still worked.) From that experience, my brother nicknamed me Gadgetboy, so this post is quite fitting.</p><p>When my wife and I moved our family to Austin, we ended up buying a ginormous house, partly because my wife and I both needed home offices, partly because we like this community and couldn’t wait for a more suitably sized house to be built, since we had to enroll our son for the new school year.</p><p>We haven’t regretted our purchase, except for the one thing we didn’t consider: cleaning it.</p><p>Cleaning a house of this size is an all-day affair for two adults. We finally admitted defeat and hired someone to do it a couple of times a month, but that’s still not enough – especially when there are two teenagers, two adults and two dogs living here. The dark wood floors ultimately get covered in tumble weeds of dog hair mixed with crumbs from dog treats.</p><p>My wife and I both work crazy hours and the last thing we want to do is have to clean again in between cleaning service, so I began exploring robot vacuums.</p><p>For years, the only good robot vacuum was a Roomba. It was crazy expensive and never quite as good as a traditional vacuum, but a lot has changed in the past few years. You can find a decent robot vacuum for around $200 these days which will work fine for a small house or apartment.</p><p>But our needs are a little different. We needed something that could clean our ground floor relatively quickly and consistently. But before I share my experience, let me give you a quick rundown of considerations when buying one of these suckers.</p><p>What’s important:</p><ul><li>Suction power</li><li>Battery life</li><li>Bin size</li><li>Ability to work on hard floors and carpet</li><li>Warranty</li><li>Repairability</li></ul><p>That’s about it.</p><p>(If you really want to geek out when shopping for a robot vacuum, visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvavJlMjlTd4wLwi9yKCtew">Vacuum Wars YouTube channel</a>. Yes, that’s a thing.)</p><p>In addition to the above, there is one critical and sometimes overlooked feature of a robot vacuum, especially for larger homes.</p><h2>Navigation</h2><p>There are basically two types of navigation: the random, bumping-around-the-house-until-it’s-clean type, and the more intelligent, S-patterned type.</p><p>Inexpensive robot vacuums will basically just bounce off of objects around your home until its onboard software determines that it has covered the area it’s supposed to clean. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but in larger homes, it can take a long time, especially since it will vacuum over spots it has already cleaned until it has completely covered the floor. This approach also makes it more likely that the robot needs to return to the dock to recharge during a session, extending the completion time even further.</p><p>Also, as part of any navigation system, you’ll want to be able to block the vacuum from going to certain places like, say, your kids playroom or keeping the vacuum from falling down stairs. Inexpensive vacuums can do this but they usually require the placement of some sort of signalling tape that you place around your home. It’s not the most attractive option.</p><p>If you want to clean larger spaces more quickly, you need more advanced navigation. That’s where the S-patterned approach comes in.</p><p>The first time this type of vacuum goes about its business, it will behave more-or-less like the navigation described above. After that, it has captured a map of your home in its onboard software and that’s where things get interesting – and faster.</p><p>Once the robot knows the basic layout of your home, it will begin to vacuum floors in a regular back-and-forth motion until it has reached the end of the room, then it will switch to another room and repeat the process until all of your designated floors are clean.</p><p>After researching robot vacuums (and watching <em>way</em> too many Vacuum Wars videos) I decided that this type of navigation was the best option for us.</p><p>When the <a href="https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI">Roborock S5 </a>went on sale (and I had a bunch of Amazon affiliate earnings banked) I made the purchase.</p><h2>Meet Rosie</h2><figure class="post__image post__image"><amp-img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//roborock_s5.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-xs.jpg 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-sm.jpg 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-md.jpg 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7//responsive/roborock_s5-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="RoboRock S5" width="930" height="1024" layout="responsive"></amp-img><figcaption>RoboRock S5</figcaption></figure><p>Setting up the <a href="https://amzn.to/2rhVDYI">Roborock S5</a> was easy as pie.

It’s a perfect, geeky, nostalgic name choice.</p><p>When it was fully charged, I gave it a go.</p><p>During its first run, it had a difficult time getting itself up onto the high-pile area rug in the living room and a few times, I realized that I forgot to put away the dog toys or slippers, so I had to run around the house to pick those up. Other than that, it did a nice job of cleaning the floors.</p><p>The second time I ran it, I got the following results.</p><figure class="post__image"><amp-img src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/img-2004.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-xs.jpg 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-sm.jpg 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-md.jpg 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/7/responsive/img-2004-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="Floor Map" width="650" height="1023" layout="responsive"></amp-img></figure><p>The yellow dot is Rosie’s home, in the dining room, next to the sideboard.</p><p>Notice the S-pattern throughout the house in almost every room.
