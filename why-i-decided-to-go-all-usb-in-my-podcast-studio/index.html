(The attic has an angled ceiling. Over the past 13 years, I probably bumped my head a thousand times….)</p><p>Here’s what I discovered during the transition process: I own a sh*t-ton of audio gear. 😉</p><p>I used to record <a href="http://odmcast.com"><em>On Digital Media</em></a>, roundtable-style in my studio and needed to be prepared to have three to four panelists for any given episode.</p><p>I’ve since moved on to <a href="http://www.qriousapp.com/category/podcast/">other podcast projects</a> that don’t require nearly as much gear or studio preparation.</p><p>Some of the gear I own includes: three mixers (two analog Behringer mixers and an Alesis Firewire model), two MXL 990’s, a KEL Audio HM-1, an MXL 604, an AKG Perception 100, a Behringer VX2000 channel strip, a Zoom H4 portable audio recorder, a bunch of inexpensive USB AD/DA adapters (from VOIP headsets) and tons of gear that I use on-location at conferences. Here’s an <a href="http://www.qriousapp.com/2013/09/20/the-eventtech-podcast-ben-hindman-ceo-of-splash/">example</a>.</p><h2 id="thetemporaryusbsolution">The “Temporary” USB Solution</h2><p>Due to my nomadic situation, I’ve been using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R76D42/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001R76D42&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brandbrains-20">Samson Go Mic</a> for almost <em>everything</em>.</p><p>As a result, I’ve discovered something else during this transition: I <em>like</em> the level of simplicity that a USB mic provides.</p><p>Of course, my current workflow is probably <em>too</em> simple, since I don’t have any redundancy right now, but here it is:</p><ul><li><p>I setup my Go Mic in one of the primary USB ports on my MacBook Air</p></li><li><p>My headphones plug into the Go Mic’s built-in 1/8″ jack for monitoring</p></li><li><p>I record the whole thing using Google Hangouts on Air</p></li></ul><p>When I’m done recording, I download the MP4 video file from YouTube, strip out the audio and drop in an intro using <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/fission/">Fission</a>, then post the final audio to the podcast feed. Sometimes I’ll trim it or run the audio through the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204551id_/http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator/">Levelator</a> before I add the intro, but that’s about it.</p><p>Given it’s small size and reasonable cost, I’ve been amazed at what the Go Mic can do. Like all condenser mics, it captures a fair amount of ambient noise, but the sound quality is pretty darn good.</p><p>And it’s <em>nice</em> not having tons of gear laying around.</p><p>Even so, when I finally moved into my new home office, I was excited to again have some space. I immediately setup a mixer, the channel strip and my KEL Audio HM-1 on a desktop mic stand and started getting acclimated to my surroundings.</p><p>I was pretty much ready to kick the “USB-vs-XLR” argument to the curb when I had a new (not-so-pleasant) discovery: ground hum. There was an unbelievable amount of ground hum using the outlets in this room and I couldn’t get rid of it.</p><p>Sure, I could have purchased a variety of gear to <em>possibly</em> get rid of it but my simple response was, “Why?”.</p><p>I haven’t experienced ground hum in more than a year because I’ve been using a USB mic during that entire time!</p><p>I sat down and weighed the pros and cons of professional XLR gear and USB gear. (Specific to <strong>my current needs</strong>, of course. Your needs may differ.)</p><h2 id="xlr">XLR</h2><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Access. I already own a ton of professional gear and have enough stuff to satisfy even the craziest of situations.</li><li>Versatility. XLR gear is versatile and provides lots of options during said crazy situations.</li><li>The sound is great.</li><li>Belt and Suspenders. It’s easy to record backup/scratch audio using a portable audio recorder or iOS device.</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>Complexity – ground hum interference, cabling, etc.</li><li>Clutters my workspace</li></ul><h2 id="usb">USB</h2><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Portability</li><li>Sound is very good</li><li>Less gear required = less clutter</li><li>Easy to use with Skype, Google Hangouts</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>Doesn’t sound <em>great</em> like my XLR gear</li><li>Less versatile, flexible – you can’t just connect another mic to the mixer – because there isn’t one. Multi-mic setups with USB can get tricky.</li><li>Recording backup/scratch audio is challenging. You can’t just hang a recorder off the mixer – because there isn’t one.</li></ul><p>But for me, the primary objection to going all-USB was the lack of channel strip/voice processing for use with Skype or Google Plus Hangouts on Air.</p><p>There’s nothing like having a compressor and noise gate when you’re recording with condenser mics.</p><h2 id="boom">BOOM</h2><p>I then had an epiphany and decided to go all-USB.</p><p>Just. Like. That.</p><p>Here’s why: I remembered my past experiences with <a href="http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/">Soundflower</a>, GarageBand and <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a>.</p><p>On a Mac, Soundflower allows you to route audio from one application or input/output channel using nothing but the Mac’s built-in audio capabilities.</p><p>I knew that if my recording software supported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Units">Audio Units</a> (which would let me tailor my mic to my liking) but also allowed me to configure the output channel, I could use the software as a channel strip!</p><p>So, what software is the best value in audio production on the Mac?</p><p><strong>GarageBand, of course.</strong></p><p>GarageBand has input and output controls, which can be found in Preferences.</p><p>After connecting the Go Mic as the input, the first thing to do was create the vocal sound I wanted using GarageBand’s effects plugins.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Monitoring should be set to “On”. I’ve had better results with the <em>“On – No Feedback Protection”</em> setting.</p><p>Once I created the sound I was looking for (and could always change later – it’s software!) I saved the settings as a GarageBand “Instrument” that I named “Go Mic”.</p><p>Next, I went to GarageBand preferences and selected “Soundflower 2ch” as my output.</p><p><strong>I was halfway there.</strong></p><p>At this point, the next most important test would be with Google Hangouts and Skype. I decided to test Skype first, since I could have lengthy conversations with the “Skype Test Call” Lady. 😉</p><p>In Skype preferences, I changed the <strong>Input</strong> channel to be GarageBand’s <strong>Output</strong> channel (“Soundflower 2ch”).</p><p>Finally, I had to route Soundflower’s output to a hardware device that I could use. I chose a Logitech USB AD/DA device. that I connected to a powered USB 3.0 hub.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> SoundFlower buffer size should be set to 64 to mitigate any latency.</p><p><strong>It was time to dial the Skype Lady.</strong></p><p>Voila!</p><p>I had a USB mic tuned to my liking using GarageBand as a channel strip and could hold repeatable conversations with the Skype Lady.</p><p>Next, I dialed up a friend over Google Hangouts to make sure it also worked and sure enough, it did.</p><p>So, there you have it: zero-cost vocal processing that can be used to record audio and video direct-to-disk or used with video conferencing or VOIP applications.</p><p>After that, I had only one thing left to figure out: recording backup/scratch audio.</p><p><strong>That’s where Audio Hijack Pro comes in.</strong></p><p>AHP allows you to “hijack” the output channel from pretty much all software on your Mac.</p><p>I’ve used it to record Skype calls, audio from my browser, audio directly from a mic – you name it.</p><p>I was hoping to be able to record both the input and output channels I described above but this proved more difficult than expected. I might still be able to figure it out but for now, I simply shut down any software that makes noise during production and set AHP to record <strong>all system audio</strong>.</p><p>If, for instance, I forget to set Skype to <em>“Do Not Disturb”</em> I can occasionally get a random notification sound in the final mix but otherwise, it’s good enough for backup audio.</p><p>[Update: Routing Diagram below]</p><h2 id="upgradingthegear">Upgrading the Gear</h2><p>While the Go Mic is good in a pinch, I know that the capsule is a bit small and that the frequency response isn’t as good as other mics – USB or otherwise.</p><p>After a bit of research and input from the Podcaster communities on Google Plus, I settled on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F4USMS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008F4USMS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brandbrains-20">Yeti USB Mic from Blue Microphones</a>.</p><p>Coupled with Blue’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DVF15A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005DVF15A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brandbrains-20">Radius Shockmount</a> and my software “control strip”, it makes for a great-sounding setup.</p><p>I’ll still use the Go Mic at the office or when I’m traveling – it’s so small and light that I always have it in my bag.</p><h2 id="whatsnextebay">What’s next? eBay.</h2><p>Anyone want to buy a channel strip? How about a mixer? A condenser mic, maybe? I can make you a good deal…</p><figure class="post__image post__image"><img class="lazyload" src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/18//responsive/2f87e-all-usb-xs.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/18//responsive/2f87e-all-usb-xs.png 300w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/18//responsive/2f87e-all-usb-sm.png 480w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/18//responsive/2f87e-all-usb-md.png 768w ,https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/18//responsive/2f87e-all-usb-lg.png 1024w" alt="" width="739" height="416"><figcaption>Routing Diagram</figcaption></figure></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 11, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/audio-production/">Audio Production</a></li><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/podcasting/">Podcasting</a></li><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/software/">Software</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/how-to-get-bandwidth-and-storage-to-spare-on-your-macbook-air/" class="inverse" rel="prev">How to Get Bandwidth and Storage to Spare on Your MacBook Air</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/on-startup-sales/" class="inverse" rel="next">On Startup Sales</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/website/69457654_10156283081645974_4851778585809125376_n.jpg" alt="John A.
