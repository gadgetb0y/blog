As soon as the snow would stop, I’d be out there with my shovel, knocking on doors and pitching the satisfaction of a clean walkway or driveway for only a few dollars.</p><p>But that wasn’t all that I did to pay my way through school.</p><p>I was also the Easter Bunny, a McDonald’s crew member, Santa Claus (until the local Mom’s complained that I was too short, then I was demoted to Elf), house framer, landscaping laborer, Kentucky Friend Chicken team member, bartender, waiter and probably a hundred other things.</p><p>Most importantly, I’ve been an entrepreneur who printed and sold novelty t-shirts, organized ski trips and pitched advertising. (At age eight, I started my own Detective Agency. That was short lived.)</p><p>Today, I’m still pitching people in my role as an entrepreneur (though there isn’t as much physical labor involved) and I know the value of finding someone who wants what I have to offer.</p><p>I <strong>want</strong> to say “Yes” to young people because I know how often people say “No.” </p><p>I don’t see enough hustle in my day-to-day experiences with young people and when I do, I want to reward it. I want to encourage these young entrepeneurs.</p><p>Sure, I ask for a lot when these kids come knocking on my door (I have a long driveway, walkway, etc.) but I also pay well and usually give them food and water while they’re busting their asses to clear my property.</p><p>If they do a good job, more often than not, I’ll ask them to come back after the next storm – though few of them do. Apparently I haven’t done enough to instill the value of a repeat customer in these kids.</p><p>That’ll be my next contribution.</p><p>Do you reward hustle when you see it?</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 11, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/entrepreneurship/">Entrepreneurship</a></li><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/kids/">Kids</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/planning-for-sandy-or-what-to-do-when-you-cant-find-a-generator/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Planning for #Sandy (Or, “What to do when you can’t find a generator”)</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/i-gave-up-my-unlimited-data-plan-and-survived/" class="inverse" rel="next">I gave up my Unlimited Data Plan.
