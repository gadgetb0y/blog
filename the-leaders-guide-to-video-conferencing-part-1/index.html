You’re on camera and speaking into a microphone more than ever and, more often than not, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p>When you went to the office or met with partners or customers, did you wear business clothes suitable for the context? Did you comb your hair? Shower? Shave?</p><p>Of course you did. That’s what it takes to create your <strong>desired net impression</strong> among your co-workers, peers, management and customers.</p><p>Why wouldn’t you be concerned about creating a desired net impression when working remotely?</p><p>Firstly, that means proper clothing and grooming (even if it’s only above your waist). That should be a given.</p><p>But if you want to do it right, you need to learn how to produce <strong>You TV</strong>.</p><p>There’s a reason that talking heads on TV or interview subjects appear in a certain way. Directors and producers want an interesting background for each subject to create interest and to eliminate distractions that may draw the viewers eye away from the subject. They want consistency of video quality, especially between cameras. They want subjects that are properly and consistently lit and, most importantly, they want those subjects to be properly <strong>heard</strong>.</p><p>Every time you get on a video conference, you’re on You TV.</p><p>I don’t expect you to create a professional studio in your home with all the gear and planning that may require, but I do expect you to <strong>look</strong> like a leader and <strong>sound</strong> like a leader when you’re working with others using video communication.</p><p>Here are some easy and inexpensive things you can do to up your game.</p><h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2><ul><li>Frame yourself</li><li>Compose an orderly background</li><li>Place your webcam at eye level</li><li>Place your brightest light source in front of you</li><li>Wear a headset with a good microphone</li></ul><p>Let’s break these down with some help from <a href="https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom">Room Rater</a>. 😉</p><h2 id="frame-yourself">Frame Yourself</h2><p>How do you want to be viewed? Are you in a working meeting, where you need access to your computer keyboard, or are you just having a conversation?</p><p>If you’re in a working meeting, you’ll probably need to be near a solid surface, so you can type or share your screen. In that case, frame yourself about an arm’s length from your camera.</p><p>If you’re just having a conversation, you might want to sit in a comfortable chair or on a couch, perhaps displaying a bit more than your head and shoulders.</p><p>In that case, you’ll have to experiment with the placement of your camera in your environment to see how you appear in your frame.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Love the blue.

Place your video conference window in the center of your screen, just below your camera. Open a word processor to a blank white page and move it to the left of the conference window. Do the same for the right side, then <strong>crank up the screen brightness</strong> to its highest level. It’s not as good as a true key light, but it works remarkably well. If your operating system supports it, also turn <strong>off</strong> Dark Mode.</p></blockquote><p><strong>How NOT to light yourself</strong></p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/56/lighting.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/56/responsive/lighting-xs.png 300w, https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/56/responsive/lighting-sm.png 480w, https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/56/responsive/lighting-md.png 768w, https://gadgetboy.org/media/posts/56/responsive/lighting-lg.png 1024w" alt="Over exposed" width="1005" height="562"></figure><p></p><p>This is me in what looks like a proof-of-life photo from a kidnapping.

Ever since they were first released in 2007, the microphone on the Apple Earpods has been outstanding. It’s especially good when you consider that they used to be included in the box for <strong>free</strong>. (I probably have half a dozen pairs around the house.) They’re comfortable to wear and if you don’t already own a pair, <a href="https://amzn.to/2W86n80">you can pick them up for under $20</a>. The cable is a little short but you can fix that easily with a 3.5mm <a href="https://amzn.to/3mbCHS7">TRRS extension cable</a>. (Make sure it’s <strong>TRRS</strong>, not <strong>TRS</strong>.)</p><p>Bluetooth headphones will also work and you get the added bonus of not having any exposed wiring. My favorite pair of everyday Bluetooth headphones are the <a href="https://amzn.to/3r0do9c">Sony WF-1000XM3</a>. They sound <strong>amazing</strong> and the microphones are very good, but they don’t look very good on camera.
