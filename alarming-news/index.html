It’s a beautiful house with original mahogany mouldings, unique pine flooring and a gorgeous wrap-around porch.</p><p>But, it also had a basement that was full of water after Hurricane Sandy, a kitchen from the 80’s (until we renovated before selling), knob-and-tube wiring and plaster walls.</p><p>Modernizing it was a money-losing battle.</p><p>Knowing that, you can probably understand why we were ecstatic when we moved into our new home in Austin.</p><p>Because it was new.</p><p>Just built.</p><p>Never lived in.</p><p>By anyone.</p><p>And it has a modern, open concept layout with modern construction and amenities. Things like energy efficient windows, central air conditioning, a sprinkler system for the lawn and a home security system.</p><p>When we lived in Maplewood, I tried an after-market home security system almost 15 years ago. It never worked properly and installation required sticking chunky white pieces of plastic on every door and window. I cancelled the service and tossed it all.</p><p>Based on that experience, it was nice to have the house pre-wired with hidden (or barely visible) alarm contacts everywhere. Better still, if we have it professionally monitored, we receive a discount on our homeowners insurance.</p><p>Something about it bugged me, though.</p><p>I mean, WE LIVE IN THE FUTURE, where everything is “smart” and networked, yet the home security system they installed in our house is the same technology that’s been in use <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="since it was invented in 1853 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://homesecurity.net/history/" target="_blank"><strong>since it was invented in 1853</strong></a>.

He’d never installed one of these before and had <strong>only watched a YouTube video</strong>. I immediately lost confidence.</p><p>And, boy, was I right.</p><p>Step number one in any job like this: label all your wires before you pull everything apart. Even though there were supposed to be six zones, he labelled only three wires – and they were all labelled incorrectly. In fact, he installed the <strong>AC power</strong> and <strong>siren</strong> connections as zones. (Thankfully, I had already disconnected the power or he would have fried the unit.)</p><p>I had to remove the old alarm system while he was <strong>reading the documentation on his phone</strong> and talking to his manager because he thought he was going to install a <strong>wireless</strong> system in the existing steel box. <strong>Nothing</strong> about the Retrofit Kit worked when he left. His “manager was going to call me to reschedule” but that never happened.</p><p>I contacted them for a refund and they were supposed to get back to me “in the morning.” That also never happened. I finally disputed the charge with my credit card issuer.</p><p>The next day, I ended up pulling apart his mess and installing the system myself. It took me about an hour. But what I discovered during the installation process <strong>really</strong> pissed me off.</p><p>When we bought the house, the alarm was pre-installed during construction. (The best time to do it, natch.) The installers wired everything to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="DSC PC1616 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dsc.com/index.php?n=products&amp;o=view&amp;id=1" target="_blank">DSC PC1616</a> – a six zone alarm system. However, there are <strong>20</strong> wired zones. They spliced numerous zones into single zone ports on the alarm system and just labelled them “Garage-Office-Dining Room-Back Door.”</p><p>It was a total clusterf*ck.</p><p>First, because it was a <strong>hack</strong> and second, because the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit runs on Lithium batteries – and there isn’t nearly enough power to activate and monitor multiple zones on a single circuit.</p><p>Since each Retrofit Alarm Kit only has eight zones, I ended up having to buy a second unit so that I could properly wire each zone. For those of you doing the math at home, yes, there will be a few zones that aren’t wired, but all of them require a thirty-foot ladder to get near them, so I feel comfortable leaving them that way, for now. I may grab a third unit when they go on sale in the future, just to make sure all zones are wired.</p><h2>Finishing Touches</h2><p>My final configuration will be to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028205592-Using-Alexa-Guard-with-Alarm-to-Detect-Broken-Glass-Smoke-and-Carbon-Monoxide" target="_blank">set up our Echo devices with Alexa Guard to act as glass break, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors</a>. (We own five Echo Dots and a Sonos Play One, though only the Echo devices support this feature.) This is a huge bonus – I don’t have to buy any additional hardware** to let the monitoring station know which sensor is triggered. If no one responds to the safety check, they’ll simply send the appropriate emergency service to the house.</p><p>My favorite part of the whole set up is the remote access. We can now arm and disarm every sensor in the system from our smartphones wherever we are and also grant access to friends and family by giving them a temporary passcode. The convenience is great.</p><p>The icing on the proverbial cake?</p><p>The professional monitoring from Ring is half the cost of monitoring from my existing service provider – and I didn’t have to pay extra for the cellular hardware. The purchase of the Ring products will almost pay for themselves in the <s>first</s> second year and the system includes all the convenience we’ve been waiting for.</p><p>I’ll unload the old system on eBay or Facebook Marketplace.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p>*Only 8 zones are supported.</p><p>**If you don’t have an Echo device, you can purchase <a rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/35l5LyL" target="_blank">a sensor that will listen for your smoke or CO alarms</a> and send the appropriate trigger to the monitoring station.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 13, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/home-automation/">Home Automation</a></li><li><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/tag/internet-of-things/">Internet of Things</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/keto-update/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Keto Update</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://gadgetboy.org/what-i-did-on-my-holiday-staycation-2020-edition/" class="inverse" rel="next">What I did on my Holiday Staycation, 2020 Edition</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://gadgetboy.org/media/website/69457654_10156283081645974_4851778585809125376_n.jpg" alt="John A.
